\abstract{Efficient collection of snow depth and density data is critical to a successful snow measurement campaign and to accurately estimate glacier winter balance. Extensive, high resolution and accurate snow accumulation measurements on glaciers are almost impossible to achieve so surveys need to optimize the extent and spacing of snow measurements to obtain reliable estimates of winter balance. To address this need, we estimate winter balance and root mean squared error (RMSE) using synthetic and real data from subsets of extensive surveys on three glaciers in the St. Elias Mountains, Yukon. We generate six different survey designs, which encompass possible snow sampling patterns and various numbers of measurement locations. We then use linear regression with topographic parameters to interpolate measurements. Analysis of both synthetic and real data indicates that an `midline \& transect' and`hourglass' sampling patterns result in the most efficient and accurate estimate of winter balance, while the midline pattern results in poor estimates of winter balance for all glaciers. RMSE decreases with increased sample size, with no further reduction after about 30 measurement locations. This study highlights the ability for future winter balance and snow survey studies to optimize snow data collection within a glacierized basin.

Estimates of basin-wide seasonal snow accumulation are critical for monitoring glacier mass balance and for predicting the availability and timing of surface runoff, especially in mountainous regions. The net accumulation of snow on a glacier over a winter season is known as the winter surface mass balance, or ``winter balance'' (WB) and is typically reported in meters of water equivalent (m\,w.e.) \citep{Cogley2011}. Winter balance accounts for half of the seasonally resolved mass balance, initializes ablation conditions and affects energy and mass exchange between the land and atmosphere \citep[e.g.][]{Hock2005, Reveillet2016}. 

Optimal survey designs for snow depth  are central to accurately estimating snow distribution and mass balance from \textit{in situ} measurements. Measuring snow depth and travelling between measurement locations is both time consuming and can disturb the snow, so care must be taken to choose a survey design that avoids bias, allows for the greatest variability to be measured and minimizes distance travelled \citep[e.g.][]{Shea2010,Kinar2015}. Moreover, the period of seasonal maximum snow depth can be brief, further motivating the need for time-efficient survey designs. 

% HERE'S WHAT I'M THINKING FOR DICTION:
% survey design: the whole thing: spatial sampling pattern plus # measurements
% sampling pattern: just the spatial design 
% sample size: # measurements

There are a number of different spatial sampling patterns that have been employed to obtain point measurements of snow depth, including pure random \citep[e.g.][]{Elder1991}, linear random \cite[e.g.][]{Shea2010}, nested \citep[e.g.][]{Schweizer2008}, gridded random \citep[e.g.][]{Bellaire2008, Elder2009, Bellaire2011} and gridded \citep[e.g.][]{Molotch2005a, Kronholm2007, Lopez2011}. Sampling schemes that incorporate randomness are favourable because they limit sampling bias by varying sample spacing and direction. However, they are less efficient than designs that incorporate grids. Grid-based designs minimize travel distance but measurements are biased by regularly spaced intervals and linear orientations which can result in an under-representation of  snow-depth variability \citep{Kronholm2007}.

Snow surveys on glaciers are conducted to estimate winter balance, and multi-year sampling programs are often established to monitor changes in winter balance with time. An optimized survey design requires (1) a sampling scheme that captures spatial variability and minimizes travel distance and (2) knowledge of the minimum number of measurement locations needed to estimate WB to the desired precision.  Optimization of winter-balance survey design is rarely investigated because the locations of snow-depth measurements are often dictated by field resources and logistics. 
Few studies have investigated the number of measurement locations needed to effectively sample the winter-balance distribution \citep[c.f.][]{Fountain1999,Walmsley2015}. The sampling patterns used for most winter-balance programs do not include randomness, and measurements are typically made along the glacier centreline \citep[e.g.][]{Kaser2003} to capture expected orographic effects \citep[e.g.][]{Grunewald2014}. However, centreline surveys are known to underestimate winter balance, so transverse profiles are often added to improve the reliability of the sampling scheme \citep[e.g.][]{Walmsley2015}. An hourglass with an inscribed circle (personal communication from C. Parr, 2016) is an alternative sampling scheme that captures changes in winter balance with elevation while avoiding the centreline bias, and is easy to travel. To our knowledge, no study has yet compared the performance of these different sampling patterns in estimating the spatially distributed winter balance.

% CORRECT IF WRONG. I'M THINKING THE SYNTHETIC DATA COMPARISON ADDRESSES PRECISION OF GLACIER-WIDE WB, WHILE THE REAL-DATA COMPARISON ADDRESSES ACCURACY AT REAL MEASUREMENT LOCATIONS. I THINK IT'S USEFUL TO ESTABLISH IN THE INTRO THESE TWO ELEMENTS OF THE STUDY AND USE THE WORDS THAT WILL HELP READERS CONNECT OBJECTIVES WITH RESULTS AND FIGURES.

The goal of this work is to determine the optimal survey design for estimating distributed and glacier-wide (integrated) winter balance. We consider both the spatial sampling scheme and the number of measurement locations in defining the optimal survey design. For three alpine glaciers in the St. Elias Mountains of Yukon, Canada, we explore the effects of survey design on: 
(1) the accuracy of estimated glacier-wide (integrated) winter balance in tests with synthetic data, and  
(2) the accuracy of estimated winter balance at distributed locations across the glacier by comparisons with real data.

\section{Study site}

We investigate winter-balance survey design for three unnamed glaciers in the Donjek Range of southwest Yukon, Canada. Situated on the northern flanks of the St. Elias Mountains, which rise sharply from the Pacific Ocean, the Donjek Range experiences a continental climate. Monitoring of snow distribution and glacier mass balance in the St. Elias Mountains began in the 1950s and 1960s with a series of research programs, including Project ``Snow Cornice''  and the Icefield Ranges Research Project \citep{Wood1948, Danby2003}. More recent studies have focused on studies of individual alpine glaciers \citep[e.g.][]{Clarke2014,Flowers2014} as well as regional glacier mass balance and dynamics \citep[e.g.][]{Arendt2008, Burgess2013,Waechter2015}. 

Glacier 4, Glacier 2 and Glacier 13 (labelling adopted from \cite{Crompton2016}) are small alpine glaciers (3.8--12.6\,km$^2$) with simple geometries. The elevation of these glaciers ranges from 1900 to 3100\,m\,a.s.l. and ELAs are located at $\sim$2500\,m. The glaciers are generally oriented southeast-northwest in steep-walled valleys. We suspect that all three glaciers are polythermal, based on a targeted study of Glacier 2 \citep{Wilson2013} and related theoretical modelling \citep{Wilson2013a}. A detailed analysis of winter-balance estimation on these three glaciers is presented by \cite{Pulwicki2017}.

\section{Methods}

Below we outline the process of determining point-scale and grid-scale values of winter balance from snow depth and density measurements. We then describe the production of gridded synthetic distributions of winter balance for each of the three study glaciers, from which synthetic sample datasets can be extracted. Finally, we present our strategy for evaluating survey design with real and synthetic data, using specific performance metrics. 

\subsection{Field measurements}

Point-scale values of winter balance are obtained from direct measurements of snow depth and density (Figure \ref{fig:Sampling}). Snow depth was measured using  3.2\,m graduated aluminium avalanche probes. 
Measurement locations followed linear and curvilinear transects in various spatial patterns termed ``midline-'' and ``transverse profiles'' and ``hourglass with inscribed circle''. 
Midline profiles, alone or combined with transverse profiles, comprise the most common survey designs used in winter-balance studies \citep[e.g.][]{Kaser2002, Machguth2006}. The midline profile aims to capture changes in winter balance with elevation, while transverse profiles provide some characterization of lateral variations in winter balance. The hourglass with inscribed circle allows for sampling in multiple directions and easy travel (personal communication from C. Parr, 2016). 

Sampling patterns were similar between study glaciers, with a sample spacing of 10--60\,m dictated by protocols for safe glacier travel. Each observer made 3--4 individual depth measurements within $\sim$1\,m at each survey location. Snow-depth measurements were largely restricted to the ablation area, where the clear distinction between snow and ice ensures that only snow from the most recent accumulation season is measured. In total, we collected more than 9000 snow-depth measurements throughout the study area. Snowpit-density profiles were measured using a wedge cutter and spring scale at three locations on each glacier that were distributed in elevation. A mean density was then calculated for each glacier and used to convert snow depth at all measurement locations to values of point-scale winter balance. The mean density and standard deviation was 348$\pm$13\,kg\,m$^{-3}$ on Glacier 4, 333$\pm$26\,kg\,m$^{-3}$ on Glacier 2 and 349$\pm$38\,kg\,m$^{-3}$ on Glacier 13. All point-scale values of winter balance located within a common digital elevation model (DEM) gridcell ($40\times40$\,m) were averaged to obtain a single value of winter balance in each sampled gridcell. 

\subsection{Tests with synthetic data}

A synthetic glacier-wide distribution of winter balance is obtained for each study glacier by linear regression of the gridcell-averaged values of WB (obtained as described above) on topographic parameters derived from a SPIRIT SPOT-5 DEM \citep{Korona2009}. These parameters include commonly used quantities \citep[e.g.][]{McGrath2015} such as elevation, slope, aspect, distance from glacier centreline, ``northness'', curvature and a wind redistribution parameter. The regression is used, along with cross-validation and Bayesian model averaging, to obtain a set of regression coefficients for each glacier  \citep{Pulwicki2017}. The resulting distribution of winter balance, hereafter referred to as the ``synthetic distribution of winter balance'' is determined by multiplying fitted regression coefficients by the corresponding topographic parameters for each gridcell in the DEM. We use the regression as an emulator to generate realistic winter-balance distributions that we can treat as synthetic data. 

Synthetic data are used to evaluate survey design, including the sampling pattern and sample number. 
We investigate various survey designs that are unique combinations of six different sampling patterns: midline, midline and transverse profiles, circle, hourglass, hourglass with inscribed circle and random. The random pattern is restricted to the area encompassed by the original field measurements (Figure \ref{fig:Sampling}). 
%[I WOULD INCLUDE THIS SENTENCE BECAUSE WE HAVE TO JUSTIFY WHY WE DIDN'T USE THE WHOLE GLACIER] All sampling patterns are restricted to the ablation area, where terrain is accessible and measurements of snow depth are generally unambiguous. 
For each sampling pattern we investigate the effect of sample size $n$, where $n$ ranges from a minimum of eight (constrained by the use of seven topographic parameters in the interpolation) to a maximum determined by the number of gridcells sampled by a given pattern (ranging from 57 to 228). 

To generate a synthetic sample size $n$ for a given sampling pattern (e.g. hourglass), we extract values of winter balance from the glacier-wide synthetic distribution 
that are regularly spaced within the chosen sampling pattern. The geographic locations of the patterns are fixed based on the original field measurements.    
We then add low or high noise to the synthetic sample set. Low noise is defined by a normal distribution with zero mean and a standard deviation derived from a series of high-density subgrid-scale measurements of winter balance on each glacier \citep{Pulwicki2017}.  
High noise is defined in the same way, but with the standard deviation three times that of low noise. This value is approximately equal to that derived by \citet{Pulwicki2017} to represent multiple sources of uncertainty including subgrid-scale variability (as in the low-noise case), the assignment of snow density in the conversion of snow depth to winter balance and measurement interpolation.
For each synthetic sample of winter balance, a randomly chosen value from the high- or low-noise distribution is added to the sample value.

To assess the performance of a given survey design (sampling pattern and sample size), we compare the original synthetic distribution of winter balance to that obtained when the topographic regression is performed using only the noisy synthetic sample set. 
%[WE ARE ACTUALLY ONLY COMPARING INTEGRATED VALUES - SHOULD MENTION THIS SOMEWHERE] -> WE COMPARE BOTH INTEGRATED (COLOURFUL GRAPH) AND DISTRIBUTED (PURPLE MAP FIGURE)
Since the noise is sampled randomly from a distribution, we repeat the regression to create 100 realizations of ``estimated winter balance'' from which we can calculate a mean and standard deviation. Comparison of the ``synthetic'' and ``estimated'' winter balances allows us to assess both the accuracy (using the mean estimated winter balance) and the precision (using the standard deviation of the estimated winter balances) 
%[NOT QUITE] 
of a given survey design, with the caveat that the utility of the results is limited by the extent to which the simulated distribution represents a plausible reality.   
 
 \subsection{Tests with real data}
 
 Using real data offers an opportunity to evaluate survey design in a different way, and provides a check on the result obtained in the synthetic tests. Here we aim to test how well the estimated winter balance compares with field measurements as a function of sampling pattern and sample number. In this series of tests, we extract subsets of $n$ samples of the observed winter balance (as described in ``Field measurements'') from individual sampling patterns (e.g. hourglass with inscribed circle) and use each subset of observed values to generate an ``estimated winter balance'' with a linear regression as described above. Because these values are real data, they already contain noise. Instead of adding noise, as in the synthetic case, we repeat the regression 100 times with randomly selected subsets of $n$ values; this approach means the values will not be regularly spaced. From these 100 realizations we calculate a mean and standard deviation of the estimated winter balance. We then compute the RMSE between all observed values of winter balance and the co-located estimates of winter balance. This comparison allows us to assess both the accuracy and precision [NOT QUITE] of a given survey design in predicting real data, but is limited to the locations of the original field measurements. By its nature, this comparison also combines the performance of the survey design with the performance of the regression. 
 %[TRUE?]  -> yes but we are comparing it to the RMSE of the regression with full data. So even on G4, where the regression is poor, we have good convergence. But I guess we're just comparing a bad regression with low n to a bad regression with high n...

 \subsection{Performance metrics}
 
To quantify the performance of each survey design, we use two metrics. The first metric we term ``convergence'', defined as the sample size ($n_{\rm c}$) needed to obtain a mean estimated glacier-wide winter balance within 5\% of the target value in the synthetic tests, or RMSE $\leq$5\% in the comparison with real data. To determine $n_{\rm c}$ we smooth the mean estimated values of glacier-wide winter balance as a function of $n$ to avoid spurious results arising from the random nature of adding noise to the synthetic samples or selecting the subset of observed values.
Convergence is a metric that describes the minimum number of measurement locations required to produce an accurate (within 5\%) estimate of winter balance. The second metric we term ``variability'', defined as the sample size ($n_{\rm v}$) needed to obtain a standard deviation of the estimated glacier-wide winter balance within 25\% of the target value in the synthetic tests, or RMSE $\leq$25\% in the comparison with real data. We again smooth the standard deviation of estimated values of glacier-wide winter balance as a function of $n$, in order to determine $n_{\rm v}$. 
``Variability'' is a metric that describes the sensitivity of the estimated winter balance to noise in the synthetic tests and sampling locations in the comparisons with real data.
%[I WANTED TO SAY IT QUANTIFIED PRECISION, BUT IT DOESN'T BECAUSE WE COMPARE THE STD WITH THE ``TRUE'' VALUE] -> the metric is still a measure of the "width" of the colour bar, it's just that the threshold width changes for each glacier
We also compute the total travel distance required to obtain the measurements required for a given survey design. An efficient survey will have low values of  $n_{\rm c}$ and $n_{\rm v}$ as well as a short travel distance.

\section{Results }

\subsection{Synthetic data}

Based on synthetic data, the most effective sampling patterns are midline \& transect and hourglass. Midline \& transect and hourglass quickly converge to the synthetic glacier-wide value of WB, have comparatively low standard deviations due to noise and involve the shortest travel distances (Figure \ref{fig:SyntheticObsWB} and Table \ref{tab:PatternRanks}). Hourglass requires slightly fewer measurements to converge to the synthetic WB and is slightly shorter than midline \& transect but midline \& transect has slightly lower variability. If using midline \& transect or hourglass sampling patterns, a sampling size of $\sim$35 is sufficient to estimate glacier-wide WB on all glaciers with no marked improvement in accuracy or precision at larger sample sizes. With all sampling patterns, WB is significantly overestimated at low sample size.

The remaining sampling patterns are less effective for estimating WB. Circle and hourglass \& circle also require small sample sizes for convergence but circle has exceptionally high variability on Glaciers 2 and 13 and hourglass \& circle requires a substantially greater travel distance. Notably, hourglass \& circle is not a substantial improvement on the hourglass sampling pattern given the considerable increase in travel distance required to sample the along the hourglass \& circle. By far the worst sampling pattern is the midline. WB values are highly sensitive to noise and even with a large number of measurement locations the validation values of WB are not achieved.

Although the convergence patterns are similar between glaciers, the standard deviation due to noise and the sample size needed to accurately estimate WB are smallest for Glacier 4 and greatest for Glacier 13 for all sampling patterns. RMSE is also larger on Glaciers 2 and 13 than on Glacier 4, especially in the accumulation area (Figure \ref{fig:SynObsRMSEmap}). When midline pattern is used, the errors are exceptionally high in areas that do not fall along the midline for all glaciers.


\subsection{Real data}

The RMSE rapidly decreases with an increased sample size for all sampling patterns on all three glaciers (Figure\ref{fig:RealObsWB}). The sampling patterns trends are similar to those of the synthetic data. Midline \& transverse, hourglass, circle, hourglass \& circle and random all perform well. However, the higher travelling distance of hourglass \& circle and random make these patterns less efficient.  Again, the worst sampling pattern is the midline, which results in exceptionally high values of RMSE for all three glaciers. There is no marked decrease in RMSE for sample sizes greater than $\sim30$ for all sampling patterns. None of the sampling patterns result in the RMSE reaching that of the full data for all three glaciers.

%% DISCUSSION

\section{Discussion}

The optimal survey design for our study region is the midline \& transverse or  hourglass pattern with a sample size of $\sim30$. Based on both synthetic and real data, both designs result in low error, is least sensitive to noise and involves relatively small travelling distance. A sample size greater than 30 does not significantly improve the accuracy of WB estimated and does not decrease error. This surprisingly low number of measurement locations indicates that high-resolution sampling is not required to accurately estimate WB. Instead, taking measurements throughout the study basin should be prioritized when choosing a survey design. If the goal is to estimate WB then field resources should be more strongly allocated to distributing measurement locations to capture basin-scale spatial trends in WB since error is greatest in areas far from sampling locations and in areas with extreme values of topographic parameters. 

The most effective survey designs capture the dominant WB-elevation trend but also have measurement locations in gridcells that span the range of other topographic parameters. Despite the fact that the synthetic distribution of WB on Glaciers 2 and 13 is largely controlled by elevation, measurements locations that are not along the midline are needed to constrain the regression. When the midline pattern is used, the topographic parameters (excluding elevation) fall within a narrow range so the regression becomes sensitive to noise. Further, the accuracy of estimated WB does not improve at large sample sizes along a midline pattern because the sampling locations do not capture relationships between WB and the remaining topographic parameters. However, if there are a large portion of measurement locations far from the midline then the elevation trend may be less strong resulting in larger errors. Random and hourglass \& circle patterns may have larger errors on Glaciers 2 and 13 as a result of the higher proportion of measurement locations far from the midline. 

On Glacier 4, the standard deviation of WB due to noise and the number of measurement locations needed to estimate WB is smaller than Glaciers 2 and 13. This trend is likely a result of the small influence of topographic parameters in the distribution of synthetic distribution of WB. The synthetic distribution of WB is derived from a linear regression between field measurements of WB and topographic parameters that explains little of the observed variance (R$^2=$0.07). As a result, glacier-wide WB is approximately equal to the mean of WB field measurements. This mostly uniform distribution of snow can therefore be described with few measurement locations, regardless of where the measurements are obtained. 

We find that, on average, WB is over-estimated with small sample sizes ($<20$), especially on Glaciers 2 and 13 with $n<10$. We hypothesize that over-estimation results from an exaggeration of the elevation regression coefficient, which is the dominant explanatory parameter for Glaciers 2 and 13. At small sample sizes, the elevation trend over-shadows the relationships with other topographic parameters and is sensitive to noise, which results in large WB values in the accumulation area. Our finds are inconsistent with \cite{Walmsley2015}, who found that using only midline probings underestimates WB.

Further work into the optimization of snow survey survey design is needed. The most obvious limitation of our study is the restriction of survey design to accessible locations in the ablation area. Lack of measurements in the accumulation area is a sub-optimal survey design. However, direct measurements of snow depth in the accumulation area are extremely costly because a large amount of time is needed to dig a snow pit, especially in regions with high accumulation. Given the importance of spatially distributed measurements though, there is likely an optimal balance between costly measurements in the accumulation area and less costly measurements in the ablation area. Use of more efficient snow-depth measurement methods, such a ground-penetrating radar (GPR) and lidar, in the accumulation area can also be investigated. Additional extensions to our work include an investigation of the size and placement of hourglass patterns and to optimize measurement locations based on factors such as topographic parameters.

\section{Conclusion}

From an analysis of synthetic and real WB data, we find that `midline \& transect' and`hourglass' sampling patterns with a sample size of approximately 30 measurement locations is the optimal survey design for estimating glacier-wide WB. Since a relatively low sample size is needed and errors are greatest in the accumulation area, we recommend that field resources be allocated such that measurements locations are distributed throughout the sample basin rather than obtaining high-resolution WB measurements. A midline sampling pattern results in poor estimates of WB and high sensitivity to noise. We find that WB is over-estimated with very small sample sizes ($n<10$) and along the midline so care should be made to adequately sample the basin to capture changes in elevation as well as transverse variation in WB.
