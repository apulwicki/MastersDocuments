	Abstract = {With an extensive ice cover and rich display of glacier behaviour, the St. Elias Mountains continue to be an enviable natural laboratory for glaciological research. Recent work has been motivated in part by the magnitude and pace of observed glacier change in this area, which is so ice-rich that ice loss has a measurable impact on global sea level. Both detection and attribution of these changes, as well as investigations into fundamental glacier processes, have been central themes in projects initiated within the last decade and based at the Kluane Lake Research Station. The scientific objectives of these projects are: 1. to quantify recent area and volume changes of Kaskawulsh Glacier and place them in historical perspective, 2. to investigate the regional variability of glacier response to climate and the modulating influence of ice dynamics, and 3. to characterize the hydromechanical controls on glacier sliding. A wide range of methods is being used, from ground-based manual measurements to space-based remote sensing.},

@article{Guo-an2001,
	Abstract = {Hydrologic data derived from digital elevation models (DEM) has been regarded as an effective method in the spatial analysis of geographical information systems (GIS). However, both DEM resolution and terrain complexity has impacts on the accuracy of hydrologie derivatives. In this study, a multi-resolution and multi-relief comparative approach was used as a major methodology to investigate the accuracy of hydrologie data derived from DEMs. The experiment reveals that DEM terrain representation error affects the accuracy of DEM hydrological derivatives (drainage networks and watershed etc.). Coarser DEM resolutions can usually cause worse results. However, uncertain result commonly exists in this calculation. The derivative errors can be found closely related with DEM vertical resolution and terrain roughness. DEM vertical resolution can be found closely related with the accuracy of DEM hydrological derivatives, especially in the smooth plain area. If the mean slope is less than 4 degrees, the derived hydrologie data are usually unreliable. This result may be helpful in estimating the accuracy of the hydrologie derivatives and determining the DEM resolution that is appropriate to the accuracy requirement of a particular user. By applying a threshold value to subset the cells of a higher accumulation flow, a stream network of a specific network density can be extracted. Some very important geomorphologie characteristics, e.g., shallow and deep gullies, can be separately extracted by means of adjusting the threshold value. However, such a flow accumulationbased processing method can not correctly derive those streams that pass through the working area because it is hard to accumulate enough flow direction values to express the stream channels at the stream's entrance area. Consequently, errors will definitely occur at the stream's entrance area. In addition, erroneous derivatives can also be found in deriving some particular rivers, e.g., perched (hanging up) rivers, anastomosing rivers and braided rivers. Therefore, more work should be done to develop and perfect the algorithms.},

@article{Lopez2010,
	Abstract = {This work analyses the responses of four regression-based interpolation methods for predicting snowpack distribution to changes in the number of data points (sample size) and resolution of the employed digital elevation model (DEM). For this purpose, we used data obtained from intensive and random sampling of snow depth (991 measurements) in a small catchment (6 km2) in the Pyrenees, Spain. Linear regression, classification trees, generalized additive models (GAMs), and a recent method based on a correction made by applying tree classification to GAM residuals were used to calculate snow-depth distribution based on terrain characteristics under different combinations of sample size and DEM spatial resolution (grid size). The application of a tree classification to GAM residuals yielded the highest accuracy scores and the most stable models. The other tested methods yielded scores with slightly lower accuracy and varying levels of robustness under different conditions of grid and sample size. The accuracy of the model predictions declined with decreasing resolution of DEMs and sample size; however, the sensitivities of the models to the number of data points showed threshold values, which has implications (when planning fieldwork) for optimizing the relation between the effort expended in gathering data and the quality of the results.

@article{Helbig2017,
	Abstract = {Snow depth is an important variable for a variety of models including land‐surface, meteorological, and climate models. Various measurement networks were therefore developed to measure snow depth on the ground. Measurement stations are generally located in gentle terrain (flat field measurements) most often at lower or mid elevation. While these sites have provided a wealth of information, various studies have questioned the representativity of such flat field measurements for the surrounding topography, especially in alpine regions. Using highly resolved snow depth maps at the peak of winter from two distinct climatic regions in Switzerland and in the Spanish Pyrenees, we developed two parameterizations to estimate domain‐averaged snow depth in coarse‐scale model applications over complex topography using easy to derive topographic parameters. The first parameterization uses a commonly applied linear lapse rate. Removing the dominant elevation gradient in mean snow depth revealed remaining underlying correlations with other topographic parameters, in particular the sky view factor. The second parameterization combines a power law elevation trend scaled with the subgrid parameterized sky view factor. Using a variety of statistic measures showed that the more complex parameterization performs better when using mean high‐resolution flat field snow depth. The performances slightly decreased when formulating the parameterizations for a single flat field snow depth measurement. Nevertheless, the more complex parameterization still outperformed the linear lapse rate model. As the parameterization was developed independently of a specific geographic region, we suggest it could be used to assimilate flat field snow depth or snowfall into coarse‐scale snow model frameworks. Mean snow depth is parameterized using elevation, sky view factors, and flat field snow depth as input Power law describes elevation trend of domain‐averaged snow depth better than a linear lapse rate Seven high‐resolution snow depth data sets were normalized, pooled, and detrended to derive the parameterizations},

@article{Kirchner2014,
	Abstract = {We present results from snow-on and snow-off airborne-scanning LiDAR measurements over a 53 km2 area in the southern Sierra Nevada. We found that snow depth as a function of elevation increased approximately 15 cm per 100 m, until reaching an elevation of 3300 m, where depth sharply decreased at a rate of 48 cm per 100 m. Departures from the 15 cm per 100 m trend, based on 1 m elevation-band means of regression residuals, showed slightly less steep increases below 2050 m; steeper increases between 2050 and 3300 m; and less steep increases above 3300 m. Although the study area is partly forested, only measurements in open areas were used. Below approximately 2050 m elevation, ablation and rainfall are the primary causes of departure from the orographic trend. From 2050 to 3300 m, greater snow depths than predicted were found on the steeper terrain of the northwest and the less steep northeast-facing slopes, suggesting that ablation, aspect, slope and wind redistribution all play a role in local snow-depth variability. At elevations above 3300 m, orographic processes mask the effect of wind deposition when averaging over large areas. Also, terrain in this basin becomes less steep above 3300 m. This suggests a reduction in precipitation from upslope lifting and/or the exhaustion of precipitable water from ascending air masses. Our results suggest a cumulative precipitation lapse rate for the 2100--3300 m range of about 6 cm per 100 m elevation for the accumulation period of 3 December 2009 to 23 March 2010. This is a higher gradient than the widely used PRISM (Parameter-elevation Relationships on Independent Slopes Model) precipitation products, but similar to that from reconstruction of snowmelt amounts from satellite snow-cover data. Our findings provide a unique characterization of the consistent, steep average increase in precipitation with elevation in snow-dominated terrain, using high-resolution, highly accurate data and highlighs the importance of solar radiation, wind redistribution and mid-winter melt with regard to snow distribution.},

	Abstract = {Abstract Ensembles used for probabilistic weather forecasting often exhibit a spread-error correlation, but they tend to be underdispersive. This paper proposes a statistical method for postprocessing ensembles based on Bayesian model averaging (BMA), which is a standard method for combining predictive distributions from different sources. The BMA predictive probability density function (PDF) of any quantity of interest is a weighted average of PDFs centered on the individual bias-corrected forecasts, where the weights are equal to posterior probabilities of the models generating the forecasts and reflect the models' relative contributions to predictive skill over the training period. The BMA weights can be used to assess the usefulness of ensemble members, and this can be used as a basis for selecting ensemble members; this can be useful given the cost of running large ensembles. The BMA PDF can be represented as an unweighted ensemble of any desired size, by simulating from the BMA predictive distribution. The BMA predictive variance can be decomposed into two components, one corresponding to the between-forecast variability, and the second to the within-forecast variability. Predictive PDFs or intervals based solely on the ensemble spread incorporate the first component but not the second. Thus BMA provides a theoretical explanation of the tendency of ensembles to exhibit a spread-error correlation but yet be underdispersive. The method was applied to 48-h forecasts of surface temperature in the Pacific Northwest in January{\^a}June 2000 using the University of Washington fifth-generation Pennsylvania State University{\^a}NCAR Mesoscale Model (MM5) ensemble. The predictive PDFs were much better calibrated than the raw ensemble, and the BMA forecasts were sharp in that 90\% BMA prediction intervals were 66\% shorter on average than those produced by sample climatology. As a by-product, BMA yields a deterministic point forecast, and this had root-mean-square errors 7\% lower than the best of the ensemble members and 8\% lower than the ensemble mean. Similar results were obtained for forecasts of sea level pressure. Simulation experiments show that BMA performs reasonably well when the underlying ensemble is calibrated, or even overdispersed.},

@article{Raftery1997,
	Abstract = {Abstract We consider the problem of accounting for model uncertainty in linear regression models. Conditioning on a single selected model ignores model uncertainty, and thus leads to the underestimation of uncertainty when making inferences about quantities of interest. A Bayesian solution to this problem involves averaging over all possible models (i.e., combinations of predictors) when making inferences about quantities of interest. This approach is often not practical. In this article we offer two alternative approaches. First, we describe an ad hoc procedure, {\^a}Occam's window,{\^a} which indicates a small set of models over which a model average can be computed. Second, we describe a Markov chain Monte Carlo approach that directly approximates the exact solution. In the presence of model uncertainty, both of these model averaging procedures provide better predictive performance than any single model that might reasonably have been selected. In the extreme case where there are many candidate predictors but no relationship between any of them and the response, standard variable selection procedures often choose some subset of variables that yields a high R 2 and a highly significant overall F value. In this situation, Occam's window usually indicates the null model (or a small number of models including the null model) as the only one (or ones) to be considered thus largely resolving the problem of selecting significant models when there is no signal in the data. Software to implement our methods is available from StatLib.},

@article{Burnham2004,
	Abstract = {The model selection literature has been generally poor at reflecting the deep foundations of the Akaike information criterion (AIC) and at making appropriate comparisons to the Bayesian information criterion (BIC). There is a clear philosophy, a sound criterion based in information theory, and a rigorous statistical foundation for AIC. AIC can be justified as Bayesian using a ``savvy'' prior on models that is a function of sample size and the number of model parameters. Furthermore, BIC can be derived as a non-Bayesian result. Therefore, arguments about using AIC versus BIC for model selection cannot be from a Bayes versus frequentist perspective. The philosophical context of what is assumed about reality, approximating models, and the intent of model-based inference should determine whether AIC or BIC is used. Various facets of such multimodel inference are presented here, particularly methods of model averaging.},

@article{Woo1978,
	Abstract = {Abstract Water balance studies in tundra regions require accurate snowfall data but weather station records often underestimate basin snow storage. However, snow storage can be determined by snow surveys conducted prior to the melt period because Arctic snowpacks do not melt during winter. Topography strongly controls snow distribution. A basin can be subdivided into various terrain types and the snow survey then establishes the snow characteristics of each terrain type so that basin snow storage is obtained as their areally weighted mean. Such a survey was carried out in small basins near Resolute, Northwest Territories, traversing different types of terrain. The results confirmed that weather station snowfall grossly underestimated basin snow storage. Since it is also desirable to simplify future snow surveys by reducing the number of transects, an error analysis was performed to determine the error resulting from a grouping of terrain types. It was found that both maximum and mean error increased as the number of terrain types was reduced, but the increase was not substantial when certain terrain types were combined. A mean error of 15\% is expected when only four types of terrain (hilltops, flats, gullies-valleys and slopes) are recognized in the survey, but the error quickly increases when further simplification of the terrain is introduced.},

@article{Reveillet2016,
	Abstractnote = {ABSTRACTBased on an extensive dataset of surface mass balances (SMB) from four glaciers in the French Alps for the period 1995--2012 and in the framework of enhanced temperature-index models, we investigate the sensitivity of seasonal glacier SMB to temperature, solar radiation, precipitation and topographical variables. Our results reveal strong correlations between winter SMB and precipitation, although the precipitation gradient cannot explain the high-accumulation rates. Based on the available point measurements, we found no relevant relationship between winter SMB and topographical variables. Temperature was found to be the main driver of ice/snow ablation while solar radiation was found to strongly influence the spatial distribution of summer SMB. We compared the ability of several enhanced temperature-index models to accurately simulate point SMB and glacier-wide MB. Our analyses revealed that the uncertainties in the simulated annual SMB due to winter SMB uncertainties are larger than differences between models and prevented us from concluding, which model is the most suitable. In contrast with results of previous studies, including solar radiation in melt models did not improve the performances when modelling glacier-wide MB. We conclude that a classical degree-day model is sufficient to simulate the long-term glacier-wide MB if the underlying processes are not required to be resolved.},

@article{Madigan1994,
	Abstract = {We consider the problem of model selection and accounting for model uncertainty in high-dimensional contingency tables, motivated by expert system applications. The approach most used currently is a stepwise strategy guided by tests based on approximate asymptotic P values leading to the selection of a single model; inference is then conditional on the selected model. The sampling properties of such a strategy are complex, and the failure to take account of model uncertainty leads to underestimation of uncertainty about quantities of interest. In principle, a panacea is provided by the standard Bayesian formalism that averages the posterior distributions of the quantity of interest under each of the models, weighted by their posterior model probabilities. Furthermore, this approach is optimal in the sense of maximizing predictive ability. But this has not been used in practice, because computing the posterior model probabilities is hard and the number of models is very large (often greater than 10<sup>11</sup>). We argue that the standard Bayesian formalism is unsatisfactory and propose an alternative Bayesian approach that, we contend, takes full account of the true model uncertainty by averaging over a much smaller set of models. An efficient search algorithm is developed for finding these models. We consider two classes of graphical models that arise in expert systems: the recursive causal models and the decomposable log-linear models. For each of these, we develop efficient ways of computing exact Bayes factors and hence posterior model probabilities. For the decomposable log-linear models, this is based on properties of chordal graphs and hyper-Markov prior distributions and the resultant calculations can be carried out locally. The end product is an overall strategy for model selection and accounting for model uncertainty that searches efficiently through the very large classes of models involved. Three examples are given. The first two concern data sets that have been analyzed by several authors in the context of model selection. The third addresses a urological diagnostic problem. In each example, our model averaging approach provides better out-of-sample predictive performance than any single model that might reasonably have been selected.},

The model is driven using coarse-resolution 40-yr reanalysis data from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ERA-40) over the period 1958--2002. The simulated precipitation is in good agreement with precipitation observations accumulated over various time scales, both in terms of magnitude and distribution. The results suggest that the model captures the main physical processes governing orographic generation of precipitation in the mountains of Iceland. The approach presented in this paper offers a credible method to obtain a detailed estimate of the distribution of precipitation in mountainous terrain for various conditions involving orographic generation of precipitation. It appears to be of great practical value to the hydrologists, glaciologists, meteorologists, and climatologists.},
