\abstract{Accurately estimating winter surface mass balance on glaciers is central to assessing glacier health and predicting glacier runoff. However, measuring and modelling snow distribution is inherently difficult in mountainous terrain. Here we explore rigorous statistical methods of estimating winter balance and its uncertainty from multiscale measurements of snow depth and density. In May 2016 we collected over 9000 manual measurements of snow depth across three glaciers in the St. Elias Mountains, Yukon, Canada. Linear regression, combined with cross correlation and Bayesian model averaging, as well as simple kriging are used to interpolate point-scale values to glacier-wide estimates of winter balance. Elevation and a wind-redistribution parameter exhibit the highest correlations with winter balance, but the relationship varies considerably between glaciers. A Monte Carlo analysis reveals that the interpolation itself introduces more uncertainty than the assignment of snow density or the representation of grid-scale variability. For our study glaciers, the winter balance uncertainty from all assessed sources ranges from 0.03\,m\,w.e. (8\%) to 0.15\,m\,w.e. (54\%). Despite the challenges associated with estimating winter balance, our results are consistent with a regional-scale winter-balance gradient. }

\section{Introduction}

Winter surface mass balance, or ``winter balance'', is the net accumulation and ablation of snow over the winter season \citep{Cogley2011}, which constitutes glacier mass input. Winter balance is half of the seasonally resolved mass balance, initializes summer ablation conditions and must be estimated to simulate energy and mass exchange between the land and atmosphere \citep[e.g.][]{Hock2005,Reveillet2016}. Effectively representing the spatial distribution of snow is also central to monitoring surface runoff and its downstream effects \citep[e.g.][]{Clark2011}.

Winter balance (WB) is notoriously difficult to estimate \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\citep[e.g.][]{Dadic2010, Cogley2011}}\hspace{0pt}%DIFAUXCMD
}\DIFaddend . Snow distribution in alpine regions is highly variable with short correlation length scales \citep[e.g.][]{Anderton2004, Egli2011, Grunewald2010, Helbig2017, Lopez2011, Lopez2013, Machguth2006, Marshall2006} and is influenced by dynamic interactions between the atmosphere and complex topography, operating on multiple spatial and temporal scales \citep[e.g.][]{Barry1992, Liston2006, Clark2011}. Simultaneously extensive, high resolution and accurate snow distribution measurements on glaciers are therefore difficult to obtain \citep[e.g.][]{Cogley2011, McGrath2015} \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{and is further complicated by the inaccessibility of many glacierized regions during the winter}\DIFaddend . Physically based models are computationally intensive and require detailed meteorological data to drive them \citep{Dadic2010}. As a result, there is significant uncertainty in estimates of winter balance, thus limiting the ability of models to represent current and projected glacier conditions.

Studies that have focused on obtaining detailed estimates of WB have used a wide range of observational techniques, including direct measurement of snow depth and density \citep[e.g.][]{Cullen2017}, lidar or photogrammerty \citep[e.g.][]{Sold2013} and ground-penetrating radar \citep[e.g.][]{Machguth2006, Gusmeroli2014, McGrath2015}. Spatial coverage of direct measurements is generally limited and comprises an elevation transect along the glacier centreline \citep[e.g.][]{Kaser2003}. Measurements are often interpolated using linear regression on only a few topographic parameters \citep[e.g.][]{MacDougall2011}, with elevation being the most common. Other established techniques include hand contouring \citep[e.g.][]{Tangborn1975}, kriging \citep[e.g.][]{Hock1999} and attributing measured winter balance values to elevation bands \citep[e.g.][]{Thibert2008}. Physical snow models have been used to estimate spatial patterns of winter balance \citep[e.g.][]{Mott2008, Schuler2008, Dadic2010} but availability of the required meteorological data generally prohibits their widespread application. Error analysis is rarely undertaken and few studies have thoroughly investigated uncertainty in spatially distributed estimates of winter balance  \citep[c.f.][]{Schuler2008}. 

More sophisticated snow-survey designs and statistical models of snow distribution are widely used in the field of snow science. Surveys described in the snow science literature are generally spatially extensive and designed to measure snow depth and density throughout a basin, ensuring that all terrain types are sampled. A wide array of measurement interpolation methods are used, including linear \citep[e.g.][]{Lopez2010} and non-linear regressions \citep[e.g.][]{Molotch2005} that include numerous terrain parameters, as well as geospatial interpolation \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\citep[e.g.][]{Erxleben2002} }\hspace{0pt}%DIFAUXCMD
}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\citep[e.g.][]{Erxleben2002, Cullen2017} }\hspace{0pt}%DIFAUXCMD
}\DIFaddend including various forms of kriging. Different interpolation methods are also combined; for example, regression kriging adds kriged residuals to a field obtained with linear regression \citep[e.g.][]{Balk2000}. Physical snow models such as \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{SnowTran-3D \mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\citep{Liston1998}}\hspace{0pt}%DIFAUXCMD
, }\DIFaddend Alpine3D \citep{Lehning2006}\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{,  }\DIFaddend and SnowDrift3D \citep{Schneiderbauer2011} are widely used, and errors in estimating snow distribution have been examined from theoretical \citep[e.g.][]{Trujillo2015} and applied perspectives \citep[e.g.][]{Turcan1975,Woo1978, Deems2006}. 

The goals of this study are to (1) critically examine methods of converting direct snow depth and density measurements to distributed estimates of winter balance and (2) identify sources of uncertainty, evaluate their magnitude and assess their combined contribution to uncertainty in glacier-wide winter balance. We focus on commonly applied, low-complexity methods of measuring and estimating winter balance in the interest of making our results broadly applicable.

\section{Study site}

The St. Elias Mountains (Fig. \ref{fig:Sampling}a) rise sharply from the Pacific Ocean, creating a significant climatic gradient between coastal maritime conditions, generated by Aleutian--Gulf of Alaska low-pressure systems, and interior continental conditions, driven by the Yukon--Mackenzie high-pressure system \citep{Taylor1969}. The boundary between the two climatic zones is generally aligned with the divide between the Hubbard and Kaskawulsh Glaciers, approximately 130\,km from the coast. Research on snow distribution and glacier mass balance in this area is limited. A series of research programs, including Project ``Snow Cornice''  and the Icefield Ranges Research Project, were operational in the 1950s and 60s \citep{Wood1948, Danby2003} and in the last 30 years, there have been a few long-term studies on selected alpine glaciers \citep[e.g.][]{Clarke2014} as well as several regional studies of glacier mass balance and dynamics \citep[e.g.][]{Arendt2008, Burgess2013,Waechter2015}.

We carried out winter balance surveys on three unnamed glaciers in the Donjek Range of the St. Elias Mountains. The Donjek Range is located approximately 40 km to the east of the regional mountain divide and has an area of about $30\times30$\,km$^2$. Glacier 4, Glacier 2 and Glacier 13 (labelling adopted from \cite{Crompton2016}) are located along a southwest-northeast transect through the range (Fig. \ref{fig:Sampling}b, Table \ref{tab:GlacierDetails}). These small alpine glaciers are generally oriented southeast-northwest, with Glacier 4 having a predominantly southeast aspect and Glaciers 2 and 13 have generally northwest aspects. The glaciers are situated in valleys with steep walls and have simple geometries. Based on a detailed study of Glacier 2  \citep{Wilson2013} and related theoretical modelling \citep{Wilson2013a} we suspect all of the study glaciers to be polythermal.

\section{Methods}

Estimating glacier-wide winter balance involves transforming measurements of snow depth and density into values of winter balance distributed across a defined grid. We do this in four steps. (1) Obtain direct measurements of snow depth and density in the field. (2) Assign density values to all depth-measurement locations to calculate point-scale values of WB at each location. \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Winter balance can be estimated as the product of snow depth and depth-averaged density. }\DIFaddend (3) Average all point-scale values within each gridcell of a digital elevation model (DEM) to obtain the gricell-averaged WB. (4) Interpolate and extrapolate these gridcell-averaged WB values to obtain estimates of WB (in m\,w.e.) in each gridcell across the domain. \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Glacier-wide WB is then calculated by taking the average of all gridcell-averaged WB values for each glacier. }\DIFaddend For brevity, we refer to these four steps as (1) field measurements, (2) density assignment, (3) gridcell-averaged WB and (4) distributed WB. Detailed methodology for each step is outlined below. \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{We use the SPIRIT SPOT-5 DEM (40$\times$40\,m) from 2005 \mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\citep{Korona2009} }\hspace{0pt}%DIFAUXCMD
throughout this study.
}\DIFaddend 

\subsection{Field measurements}

\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Our sampling campaign involved four people and occurred between 5--15 May 2016, which falls within the period of historical peak snow accumulation in southwestern Yukon (Yukon Snow Survey Bulletin and Water Supply Forecast, May 1, 2016). Snow depth is generally accepted to be more variable than density \mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\citep{Elder1991, Clark2011, Lopez2013} }\hspace{0pt}%DIFAUXCMD
so we chose a sampling design that resulted in a high ratio ($\sim$55:1) of snow depth to density measurements. In total, we collected more than 9000 snow-depth measurements and more than 100 density measurements throughout the study area (Table \ref }{\DIFadd{tab:GlacierDetails}}\DIFadd{).
}

\DIFadd{During the field campaign there were two small accumulation events. The first, on 6 May 2016, also involved high winds so accumulation could not be determined. The second, on 10 May 2016, resulted in 0.01\,m\,w.e accumulation measured at one location on Glacier 2. Assuming both accumulation events contributed a uniform 0.01\,m\,w.e accumulation to all study glaciers then our survey did not capture $\sim$3\% and $\sim$2\% of estimated glacier-wide winter balance on Glaciers 4 and 2, respectively. We therefore assume that these accumulation events were negligible. Positive temperatures and clear skies occurred between 11--16 May 2016, which we suspect resulted in melt occurring on Glacier 13. The snow in the lower part of the ablation area of Glacier 13 was isothermal and showed clear signs of melt and metamorphosis. The total amount of melt during the study period was not estimated so no corrections were made. 
}

\DIFaddend \subsubsection{Sampling design}

The snow surveys were designed to capture variability in snow depth at regional, basin, gridcell and point scales \citep{Clark2011}. To capture variability at the regional scale we chose three glaciers along a transect aligned with the dominant precipitation gradient  (Fig. \ref{fig:Sampling}) \citep{Taylor1969}. To account for basin-scale variability, snow depth was measured along linear and curvilinear transects on each glacier (Fig. \ref{fig:Sampling}c) with a sample spacing of 10--60 m (Fig. \ref{fig:Sampling}d). Sample spacing was constrained by protocols for safe glacier travel, while survey scope was constrained by the need to complete all surveys within the period of peak accumulation. We selected centreline and transverse transects as the most commonly used survey designs in winter balance studies \citep[e.g.][]{Kaser2003, Machguth2006} as well as an hourglass pattern with an inscribed circle, which allows for sampling in multiple directions and easy travel (personal communication from C. Parr, 2016). To capture variability at the grid scale, we densely sampled up to four gridcells on each glacier using a linear-random sampling design \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\citep{Shea2010} }\hspace{0pt}%DIFAUXCMD
}\DIFaddend we term a `zigzag'. To capture point-scale variability, each observer made 3--4 depth measurements within $\sim$1 m (Fig. \ref{fig:Sampling}\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{e}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{f}\DIFaddend ) at each transect measurement location. 
\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{In total, we collected more than 9000 snow-depth measurements throughout the study area (Table \ref }%DIFDELCMD < {%%%
\DIFdel{tab:GlacierDetails}%DIFDELCMD < }%%%
\DIFdel{). 
}\DIFdelend 

\subsubsection{Snow depth: transects}

\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Winter balance can be estimated as the product of snow depth and depth-averaged density. Snow depth is generally accepted to be more variable than density \mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\citep{Elder1991, Clark2011, Lopez2013} }\hspace{0pt}%DIFAUXCMD
so we chose a sampling design that resulted in a high ratio ($\sim$55:1) of snow depth to density measurements. Our sampling campaign involved four people and occurred between 5--15 May 2016, which falls within the period of historical peak snow accumulation in southwestern Yukon (Yukon Snow Survey Bulletin and Water Supply Forecast, May 1, 2016). }\DIFdelend While roped-up for glacier travel with fixed distances between observers, the lead observer used a single-frequency GPS unit (Garmin GPSMAP 64s) to navigate between predefined transect measurement locations (Fig. \ref{fig:Sampling}e). The remaining three observers used 3.2 m graduated aluminum avalanche probes to make snow-depth measurements. The locations of each set of depth measurements, made by the second, third and fourth observers, are estimated using the recorded location of the first observer, the approximate distance between observers and the direction of travel. \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{The 3--4 point-scale depth measurements are averaged to obtain a single depth measurement at each transect measurement location. When considering snow variability at the point scale as a source of uncertainty in snow depth measurements, we find that the mean standard deviation of point-scale snow depth measurements is found to be $<$7\% of the mean snow depth for all study glaciers.
}\DIFaddend 

Snow-depth sampling was concentrated in the ablation area to ensure that only snow from the current accumulation season was measured. The boundary between snow and firn in the accumulation area can be difficult to detect and often misinterpreted, especially when using an avalanche probe \citep{Grunewald2010,Sold2013}. We intended to use a firn corer to measure winter balance in the accumulation area, but cold snow combined with positive air temperatures led to cores being unrecoverable. Successful snow depth \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{and density }\DIFdelend measurements within the accumulation area were made either in snow pits or using a Federal Sampler (described below) to unambiguously identify the snow--firn transition. 

\subsubsection{Snow depth: zigzags}

\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{To capture snow-depth variability within a single DEM gridcell, we implemented a linear-random zigzag sampling design \mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\citep{Shea2010}}\hspace{0pt}%DIFAUXCMD
. }\DIFdelend We measured depth at random intervals of 0.3--3.0\,m along two `Z'-shaped patterns \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\citep{Shea2010}}\hspace{0pt}%DIFAUXCMD
}\DIFaddend , resulting in 135--191 measurements per zigzag, within three to four $40\times40$ m gridcells (Fig. \ref{fig:Sampling}g) per glacier. Random intervals were machine-generated from a uniform distribution in sufficient numbers that each survey was unique. Zigzag locations were randomly chosen within the upper, middle and lower regions of the ablation area of each glacier. \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{A fourth zigzag was measured }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Extra time in the field allowed us to measure a fourth zigzag }\DIFaddend on Glacier 13 in the central ablation area at $\sim$2200 m a.s.l. 

\subsubsection{Snow density}

Snow density was measured using a Snowmetrics wedge cutter in three snow pits on each glacier\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{, as well as with a Geo Scientific Ltd. metric Federal Sampler. }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{. }\DIFaddend Within the snow pits (SP), we measured a vertical density profile (in 5 cm increments) with the $5\times10\times 10$ cm wedge-shaped cutter (250 cm$^3$) and a Presola 1000\,g spring scale \citep[e.g.][]{Gray1981,Fierz2009}. Wedge-cutter error is approximately $\pm$6\% \citep[e.g.][]{Proksch2016,Carroll1977}. Uncertainty in estimating density from \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{snow-pit }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{SP }\DIFaddend measurements also stems from incorrect assignment of density to layers that cannot be sampled (e.g. ice lenses and hard layers). We attempt to quantify this uncertainty by varying estimated ice-layer thickness by $\pm$1 cm ($\leq$100\%) of the recorded thickness, ice layer density between 700 and 900\,kg\,m$^{-3}$ and the density of layers identified as being too hard to sample (but not ice) between 600 and 700\,kg\,m$^{-3}$. When considering all three sources of uncertainty, the range of integrated density values is always less than 15\% of the reference density. Depth-averaged densities for shallow pits ($<$50\,cm) that contain ice lenses are particularly sensitive to changes in prescribed density and ice-lens thickness. 

While \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{snow pits }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{SP }\DIFaddend provide the most accurate measure of snow density, digging and sampling a \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{snow pit }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{SP }\DIFaddend is time and labour intensive. Therefore, a \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Federal Snow }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Geo Scientific Ltd. metric Federal }\DIFaddend Sampler (FS) \citep{Clyde1932} \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{with a 3.2--3.8\,cm diameter sampling tube}\DIFaddend , which directly measures depth-integrated snow-water equivalent, was used to augment the snow pit measurements. A minimum of three \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Federal Sampler }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{FS }\DIFaddend measurements were taken at each of 7--19 locations on each glacier and an additional eight \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Federal Sampler }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{FS }\DIFaddend measurements were co-located with each snow pit profile. Measurements for which the snow core length inside the sampling tube was less than 90\% of the snow depth were discarded. Densities at each measurement location (eight at each snow pit, three elsewhere) were then averaged, with the standard deviation taken to represent the uncertainty. \DIFdelbegin %DIFDELCMD <

\DIFdel{During the field campaign there were two small accumulation events. The first, on 6 May 2016, also involved high winds so accumulation could not be determined. The second, on 10 May 2016, resulted in 0.01 m w.e accumulation measured at one location on Glacier 2. Positive temperatures and clear skies occurred between 11--16 May 2016, which we suspect resulted in melt occurring on Glacier 13. The snow in the lower part of the ablation area of Glacier 13 was isothermal and showed clear signs of melt and metamorphosis. The total amount of accumulation and melt during the study period could not be estimated so no corrections were made}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{The mean standard deviation of FS-derived density was $\leq$4\% of the mean density for all glaciers}\DIFaddend .

\subsection{Density assignment}

Measured snow density must be interpolated or extrapolated to estimate point-scale winter balance at each snow-depth sampling location. We employ four commonly used methods to interpolate and extrapolate density (Table \ref{tab:densityOptions}): (1) calculate mean density over an entire mountain range \citep[e.g.][]{Cullen2017}, (2) calculate mean density for each glacier \citep[e.g.][]{Elder1991, McGrath2015}, (3) linear regression of density on elevation for each glacier \citep[e.g.][]{Elder1998, Molotch2005} and (4) calculate mean density using inverse-distance weighting \citep[e.g.][]{Molotch2005} for each glacier.  Densities derived from \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{snow-pit (SP ) measurements and the Federal Sampler (FS ) }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{SP and FS measurements }\DIFaddend are treated separately, for reasons explained below, resulting in eight possible methods of assigning density.

\subsection{Gridcell-averaged winter balance}

We average one to six (mean of 2.1 measurements) point-scale values of WB within each $40 \times 40$\,m DEM gridcell to obtain the gricell-averaged WB. The locations of individual measurements have uncertainty due to the error in the horizontal position given by the GPS unit and the estimation of observer location based on the recorded GPS positions of the navigator. This location uncertainty could result in the incorrect assignment of a point-scale WB to a particular gridcell. However, this source of error is not further investigated because we assume that the uncertainty in gridcell-averaged WB is captured in the zigzag measurements described below. \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Uncertainty }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Error }\DIFaddend due to having multiple observers \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{was also evaluated . There are }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{is also evaluated by conducting an analysis of variance (ANOVA) of snow-depth measurement along a transect and testing for differences between observers. We find }\DIFaddend no significant differences between snow-depth measurements made by observers along any transect (p$>$0.05), with the exception of the first transect on Glacier 4 (51 measurements)\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{. 
}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{, where snow depth values collected by one observer were, on average, greater than the snow depth measurements taken by the other two observers ( p$<$0.01). Since this was the first transect completed and the only one to show differences by observer, this difference can be considered an anomaly. This result shows that observer bias is likely to not affect the results of this study and no corrections to the data based on observer were applied.
}\DIFaddend 

\subsection{Distributed winter balance}

Gridcell-averaged values of WB are interpolated and extrapolated across each glacier using linear regression (LR) and simple kriging (SK). The \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{regression }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{LR }\DIFaddend relates gridcell-averaged WB and various topographic parameters, as this method is simple and has precedent for success \citep[e.g.][]{McGrath2015}. Instead of a basic \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{regression }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{LR }\DIFaddend however, we use cross-validation and model averaging to test all combinations of the topographic parameters. We compare the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{regression approach with simple kriging (SK)}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{LR approach with SK}\DIFaddend , a data-driven interpolation method free of any physical interpretation \citep[e.g.][]{Hock1999}.

\subsubsection{Linear regression}

In the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{regression}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{LR}\DIFaddend , we use commonly applied topographic parameters as in \cite{McGrath2015}, including elevation, slope, aspect, curvature, ``northness'' and a wind-redistribution parameter \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{($Sx$ from \mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\cite{Winstral2002}}\hspace{0pt}%DIFAUXCMD
)}\DIFaddend ; we add distance-from-centreline as an additional parameter. \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Topographic parameters are standardized for use in the LR. For details on data and methods used to estimate the topographic parameters see the Supplementary Material. }\DIFaddend Our sampling design ensured that the ranges of topographic parameters associated with our measurement locations represent more than 70\% of the total area of each glacier (except elevation on Glacier 2, where our measurements captured only 50\%). 
\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Topographic parameters are standardized and then weighted by }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin 

\DIFadd{The goal of the LR is to obtain }\DIFaddend a set of fitted regression coefficients ($\beta_i$) \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{calculated by minimizing the sum of squares of the vertical deviations of each datum from the regression line \mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\citep{Davis1986}}\hspace{0pt}%DIFAUXCMD
. For details on data and methods used to estimate the topographic parameters see the Supplementary Material. }%DIFDELCMD < 

%DIFDELCMD < %%%
\DIFdel{To }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{that correspond to each topographic parameter and to a model intercept. The LR implemented in this study is an extension of a basic multiple linear regression; we use cross-validation to }\DIFaddend avoid overfitting the data and \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{model averaging }\DIFaddend to incorporate every possible combination of topographic parameters\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{, cross-validation and model averaging are implemented. 
}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{. 
}

\DIFaddend First, cross-validation is used to obtain a set of \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{$\beta_i$ values }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{regression coefficients }\DIFaddend that have the greatest predictive ability \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\citep{Kohavi1995}}\hspace{0pt}%DIFAUXCMD
}\DIFaddend . We randomly select 1000 subsets of the data (2/3 of the values) \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{to fit the LR and }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{and fit a basic multiple linear regression (implemented in MATLAB) to the data subsets, thus obtaining 1000 sets of regression coefficients. The basic multiple linear regression calculates a set of regression coefficients by minimizing the sum of squares of the vertical deviations of each datum from the regression line \mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\citep{Davis1986}}\hspace{0pt}%DIFAUXCMD
. Distributed winter balance is then calculated by weighting each topographic parameter by the corresponding regression coefficient for all DEM gridcells. We then }\DIFaddend use the remaining data (1/3 of the values) to calculate a root mean squared error (RMSE) \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\citep{Kohavi1995}}\hspace{0pt}%DIFAUXCMD
}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{between the estimated WB and the observed WB for corresponding locations}\DIFaddend . From the 1000 sets of $\beta_i$ values, we select the set that results in the lowest RMSE. 
\DIFaddbegin 

\DIFaddend Second, we use model averaging to account for uncertainty when selecting predictors and to maximize the model's predictive ability \citep{Madigan1994}. Models are generated by calculating a set of \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{$\beta_i$ }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{regression coefficients }\DIFaddend as described above for all possible combinations of topographic parameters (\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{resulting in }\DIFaddend 2$^7$ models\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{, or sets of regression coefficients}\DIFaddend ). Using a Bayesian framework, model averaging involves weighting all models by their posterior model probabilities \citep{Raftery1997}. \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{To obtain the final regression coefficients, the $\beta_i$ values from each model }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{The models (i.e. sets of regression coefficients) }\DIFaddend are weighted according to the relative predictive success of the model, as assessed by the value of the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) \citep{Burnham2004}. BIC penalizes more complex models which further reduces the risk of overfitting. The \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{distributed WB is then }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{final set of regression coefficients is then the weighted sum of regression coefficients from all models. Distributed WB is }\DIFaddend obtained by applying the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{resulting }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{final set of }\DIFaddend regression coefficients to the topographic parameters associated with each gridcell. 

\subsubsection{Simple kriging}

\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Simple kriging (SK ) }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{SK }\DIFaddend is a data-driven method of estimating variables at unsampled locations by using the isotropic spatial correlation (covariance) of measured values to find a set of optimal weights \citep{Davis1986, Li2008}. \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Simple kriging }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{SK }\DIFaddend assumes spatial correlation between sampling locations that are distributed across a surface and then applies the correlation to interpolate between these locations. We used the \texttt{DiceKriging} R package \citep{Roustant2012} to calculate the maximum likelihood covariance matrix, as well as the range distance ($\theta$) and nugget for gridcell-averaged values of winter balance. The range distance is a measure of data correlation length and the nugget is the residual that encompasses sampling-error variance as well as the spatial variance at distances less than the minimum sample spacing \citep{Li2008}. \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Unlike topographic regression, simple kriging }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{A Mat\'ere covariance function with $\nu$=5/2 is used to define a stationary and isotropic covariance and covariance kernels are parameterized as in \mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\cite{Rasmussen2006}}\hspace{0pt}%DIFAUXCMD
. Unlike LR, SK }\DIFaddend is not useful for generating hypotheses to explain the physical controls on snow distribution, nor can it be used to estimate winter balance on unmeasured glaciers.


\subsection{Uncertainty analysis \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{using a Monte Carlo approach}\DIFaddend }

\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Three sources of uncertainty are considered separately: the uncertainty due to (1) grid-scale variability of WB ($\sigma_{\mathrm{GS}}$), (2) the assignment of snow density ($\sigma_{\rho}$) and (3) interpolating and extrapolating gridcell-averaged values of WB ($\sigma_{\mathrm{INT}}$). }\DIFaddend To quantify the uncertainty \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{of grid-scale and interpolation uncertainty }\DIFaddend on estimates of glacier-wide WB we conduct a Monte Carlo analysis, which uses repeated random sampling of input variables to calculate a distribution of output variables \citep{Metropolis1949}. We repeat the random sampling process 1000 times, resulting in a distribution of values of the glacier-wide WB based on uncertainties associated with the four steps outlined above. \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{We use }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Density assignment uncertainty is calculated as }\DIFaddend the standard deviation of \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{this distribution as a useful metric of uncertainty on the }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{the eight resulting values of }\DIFaddend glacier-wide \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{WB. Three sources of uncertainty are considered separately: the uncertainty due to (1) grid-scale variability of WB ($\sigma_{\mathrm{GS}}$), (2) the assignment of snow density ($\sigma_{\rho}$) and (3) interpolating and extrapolating gridcell-averaged values of WB ($\sigma_{\mathrm{INT}}$). 
These individual }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{winter balance. 
Individual }\DIFaddend sources of uncertainty are propagated through the conversion of snow depth and density measurements to glacier-wide WB. Finally, the combined effect of all three sources of uncertainty on the glacier-wide WB is quantified. We \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{use the standard deviation of this distribution as a useful metric of uncertainty on the glacier-wide WB. We }\DIFaddend calculate a relative uncertainty as the normalized sum of differences between every pair of one hundred distributed WB estimates including $\sigma_{\mathrm{GS}}$ and $\sigma_{\mathrm{INT}}$.

	\subsubsection{Grid-scale uncertainty ($\sigma_{\mathrm{GS}}$)}
We make use of the zigzag surveys to quantify the true variability of WB at the grid scale. Our limited data do not permit a spatially-resolved assessment of grid-scale uncertainty, so we characterize this uncertainty as uniform across each glacier and represent it by a normal distribution. The distribution is centred at zero and has a standard deviation equal to the mean standard deviation of all zigzag measurements for each glacier. For each iteration of the Monte Carlo, WB values are randomly chosen from the distribution and added to the values of gridcell-averaged WB. These perturbed gridcell-averaged values of WB are then used in the interpolation. We represent uncertainty in glacier-wide WB due to grid-scale uncertainty ($\sigma_{\mathrm{GS}}$) as the standard deviation of the resulting distribution of glacier-wide WB estimates.  

	\subsubsection{Density assignment uncertainty ($\sigma_{\rho}$)}
We incorporate uncertainty due to the method of density assignment by carrying forward all eight density interpolation methods (Table \ref{tab:densityOptions}) when estimating glacier-wide WB. By choosing to retain even the least plausible options, as well as the questionable FS data, this approach results in a generous assessment of uncertainty. We represent the glacier-wide WB uncertainty due to density assignment uncertainty ($\sigma_{\rho}$) as the standard deviation of glacier-wide WB estimates calculated using each density assignment method.

	\subsubsection{Interpolation uncertainty ($\sigma_{\mathrm{INT}}$)}
We represent the uncertainty due to interpolation of gridcell-averaged WB in different ways for LR and SK. LR interpolation uncertainty is represented by a multivariate normal distribution of possible regression coefficients ($\beta_i$). The standard deviation of each distribution is calculated using the covariance of regression coefficients as outlined in \cite{Bagos2015}, which ensures that regression coefficients are internally consistent. The $\beta_i$ distributions are randomly sampled and used to calculate gridcell-estimated WB.

SK interpolation uncertainty is represented by the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{95\% confidence interval for }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{standard deviation for each }\DIFaddend gridcell-estimated \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{values }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{value }\DIFaddend of WB generated by the \texttt{DiceKriging} package. \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{From this confidence interval, the standard deviation of each gridcell-estimated WB is then calculated. }\DIFdelend The standard deviation of glacier-wide WB is then found by taking the square root of the average variance of each gridcell-estimated WB. The final distribution of glacier-wide WB values is centred at the glacier-wide WB estimated with SK. For simplicity, the standard deviation of glacier-wide WB values that result from either LR or SK interpolation uncertainty is referred to as $\sigma_{\mathrm{INT}}$.

\end{figure*}

\subsubsection{Snow depth}
Mean snow depth varied systematically across the study region, with Glacier 4 having the highest mean snow depth and Glacier 13 having the lowest (Fig. \ref{fig:DepthBoxplot_SPvsFS}\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{a}\DIFaddend ). At each measurement location, the median range of measured depths (3--4 points) as a percent of the mean local depth is 2\%, 11\% and 12\%, for Glaciers 4, 2 and 13, respectively. While Glacier 4 has the lowest point-scale variability, as assessed above, it also has the highest proportion of outliers, indicating a more variable snow depth across the glacier. The average standard deviation of all zigzag depth measurements is 0.07\,m, 0.17\,m and 0.14\,m, for Glaciers 4, 2 and 13, respectively. When converted to values of WB using the local FS-derived density measurement, the average standard deviation is 0.027\,m\,w.e., 0.035\,m\,w.e. and 0.040\,m w.e. WB data for each zigzag are not normally distributed (Fig. \ref{fig:ZigzagHistogram}).

\subsubsection{Snow density}

Contrary to expectation, co-located FS and SP measurements are found to be uncorrelated (R$^2=0.25$, Fig. \ref{fig:DepthBoxplot_SPvsFS}b). The \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Federal Sampler }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{FS }\DIFaddend appears to oversample in deep snow and undersample in shallow snow. Oversampling by small-diameter \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{(3.2--3.8\,cm) }\DIFdelend sampling tubes has been observed in previous studies, with a percent error between 6.8\% and 11.8\% \citep[e.g.][]{Work1965, Fames1982, Conger2009}. Studies that use \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Federal Samplers }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{FS }\DIFaddend often apply a 10\% correction to all measurements for this reason \citep[e.g.][]{Molotch2005}. Oversampling has been attributed to slots ``shaving'' snow into the tube as it is rotated \citep[e.g.][]{Dixon2012} and to snow falling into the slots, particularly for snow samples with densities $>$400\,kg\,m$^{-3}$ and snow depths $>$1\,m \citep[e.g.][]{Beaumont1963}. Undersampling is likely to occur due to loss of snow from the bottom of the sampler \citep{Turcan1975}. Loss by this mechanism may have occurred in our study, given the isothermal and melt-affected snow conditions observed over the lower reaches of Glaciers 2 and 13. Relatively poor \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Federal Sampler }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{FS }\DIFaddend spring-scale sensitivity also calls into question the reliability of measurements for snow depths $<$20\,cm.

Our FS-derived density values are positively correlated with snow depth (R$^2= 0.59$). This relationship could be a result of physical processes, such as compaction in deep snow and preferential formation of depth hoar in shallow snow, but is more likely a result of measurement artefacts for a number of reasons. First, the total range of densities measured by the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Federal Sampler }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{FS }\DIFaddend seems improbably large (227--431\,kg\,m$^{-3}$)\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{given the conditions at the }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{. At the }\DIFaddend time of sampling \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{the snow pack had little fresh snow, which confounds the low density values, and was not yet saturated and had few ice lenses, which confounds the high density values}\DIFaddend . Moreover, the range of FS-derived values is much larger than than of SP-derived values when co-located measurements are compared. Second, compaction effects of the magnitude required to explain the density differences between SP and FS measurements would not be expected at the measured snow depths (up to 340\,cm). Third, no linear relationship exists between depth and SP-derived density (R$^2 = 0.05$). These findings suggest that the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Federal Sampler }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{FS }\DIFaddend measurements have a bias for which we have not identified a suitable correction. \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Despite this bias, we use FS-derived densities to generate a range of possible WB estimates and to provide a generous estimate of uncertainty arising from density assignment.
}\DIFaddend 

\subsection{Density assignment}

Given the lack of correlation between co-located SP- and FS-derived densities (Fig. \ref{fig:DepthBoxplot_SPvsFS}), we use the densities derived from these two methods separately (Table \ref{tab:densityOptions}). SP-derived regional (S1) and glacier-mean (S2) densities are within one standard deviation of the corresponding FS-derived densities (F1 and F2) although SP-derived density values are larger (see Supplementary Material, Table S2). For both SP- and FS-derived densities, the mean density for any given glacier (S2 or F2) is within one standard deviation of the mean across all glaciers (S1 or F1). Correlations between elevation and SP- and FS-derived densities are generally high (R$^2>$ 0.5) but vary between glaciers (Supplementary material, Table S2). For any given glacier, the standard deviation of the 3--4 SP- or FS-derived densities is $<$13\% of the mean of those values (S2 or F2) (Supplementary material, Table S2). We adopt S2 (glacier-wide mean of SP-derived densities) as the reference method of density assignment. Though the method described by S2 does not account for known basin-scale spatial variability in snow density \citep[e.g.][]{Wetlaufer2016}, it is commonly used in winter balance studies\citep[e.g.][]{Elder1991,McGrath2015,Cullen2017}. 

\subsection{Gridcell-averaged winter balance}

The distributions of gridcell-averaged WB values for the individual glaciers are similar to those in Fig. \ref{fig:DepthBoxplot_SPvsFS}a but with fewer outliers \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{(see Supplementary Material)}\DIFaddend . The standard deviations of WB values determined from the zigzag surveys are almost twice as large as the mean standard deviation of point-scale WB values within a gridcell measured along transects \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{(see Supplementary Material)}\DIFaddend . However, a small number of gridcells sampled in transect surveys have standard deviations in WB that exceed 0.25\,m\,w.e. ($\sim$10 times greater than those for zigzag surveys). 
\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{We nevertheless assume that the gridcell uncertainty is captured with dense sampling in zigzag gridcells.

On Glacier 4, distributed WB estimated with LR and the relatively uncertainty is almost uniform due to the small regression coefficients for all topographic parameters. The explained variance of the LR-estimated WB differs considerably between glaciers (Fig. \ref{fig:observedVSestimated_S2}), with the best correlation between modelled and observed WB on Glacier 2.

\DIFaddend Of the topographic parameters in the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{linear regression}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{LR}\DIFaddend , elevation ($z$) is the most significant predictor of gridcell-averaged WB for Glaciers 2 and 13, while wind redistribution ($Sx$) is the most significant predictor for Glacier 4 (Fig. \ref{fig:BetaCoeffs}\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{, Fig. \ref{fig:LR_SK_map}}\DIFdelend ). As expected, gridcell-averaged WB is positively correlated with elevation where the correlation is significant. It is possible that the elevation correlation was accentuated due to melt onset for Glacier 13 in particular. \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Many  studies }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Our results are consistent with many studies that }\DIFaddend have found elevation to be the most significant predictor of winter-balance data \citep[e.g.][]{Machguth2006, McGrath2015}. \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{However, }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{The }\DIFaddend WB--elevation \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{gradients vary considerably between glaciers \mbox{%DIFAUXCMD

but considerably smaller than many reported WB--elevation gradients, which range from about 60--240\,mm/100\,m \mbox{%DIFAUXCMD

. Extrapolating linear relationships to unmeasured locations typically results in large uncertainties, as seen by the large WB values (Fig. \ref{fig:LR_SK_map}) and large relative uncertainty (Fig. \ref{fig:WSMBspatialvar}) in the high-elevation regions of the accumulation areas of Glaciers 2 and 13. The low of }\DIFaddend correlation between WB \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{on glaciers and topographic parameters, with }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{and elevation Glacier 4 is consistent with \mbox{%DIFAUXCMD

\citep[e.g.][]{Grabiec2011,Lopez2011}}\hspace{0pt}%DIFAUXCMD
. 
Extrapolating relationships to unmeasured locations, especially the accumulation area, is susceptible to large uncertainties (Fig. \ref{fig:WSMBspatialvar}). This extrapolation has a considerable effect on values of glacier-wide WB, as the highest values of WB are typically found in the accumulation area  (Fig. \ref{fig:LR_SK_map}).

Gridcell-averaged WB is negatively correlated with $Sx$ on Glacier 4, counter-intuitively indicating less snow in what would be interpreted as sheltered areas. Gridcell-averaged WB is positively correlated with $Sx$ on Glaciers 2 and 13. Similarly, gridcell-averaged WB is positively correlated with curvature on Glacier 4 and negatively correlated on Glaciers 2 and 13. \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Wind redistribution and preferential deposition of snow are known to have a large influence on snow distribution at sub-basin scales \mbox{%DIFAUXCMD

in a study of six glaciers in Alaska (DEM resolutions of 5 m) where elevation and $Sx$ were the only significant parameters for all glaciers; $Sx$ regression coefficients were smaller than elevation regression coefficients, and in some cases, negative. While our }\DIFaddend results point to wind having an impact on snow distribution, \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{but }\DIFdelend the wind redistribution parameter ($Sx$) may not adequately capture these effects at our study sites. For example, Glacier 4 is located in a curved valley with steep side walls, so specifying a single cardinal direction for wind may not be adequate. Further, the scale of deposition may be smaller than the resolution of the $Sx$ parameter estimated from the DEM. \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Our results corroborate those of \mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\cite{McGrath2015} }\hspace{0pt}%DIFAUXCMD
in a study of six glaciers in Alaska (DEM resolutions of 5 m) where elevation and $Sx$ were the only significant parameters for all glaciers; $Sx$ regression coefficients were smaller than elevation regression coefficients, and in some cases, negative. In addition to wind redistribution, }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Creation of a parametrization for }\DIFaddend sublimation from blowing snow\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{has also }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{, which has }\DIFaddend been shown to be an important mechanism of mass loss from ridges \citep[e.g.][]{Musselman2015}\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{. Incorporating such losses, as well as redistribution and preferential deposition, may be important for improving representations of distributed winter balance}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{, may also improve explanatory power of LR for our study sites}\DIFaddend .

We find that transfer of LR coefficients between glaciers results in large estimation errors. Regression coefficients from Glacier 4 produce the highest root mean squared error (0.38\,m\,w.e. on Glacier 2 and 0.40\,m\,w.e. on Glacier 13, see Table \ref{tab:WSMB&RMSE} for comparison) and glacier-wide WB values are the same for all glaciers (0.64\,m\,w.e.) due to the dominance of the regression intercept. Even if the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{regression }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{LR }\DIFaddend is performed with WB values from all glaciers combined, the resulting coefficients produce large root mean squared errors when applied to  individual glaciers (0.31\,m\,w.e., 0.15\,m\,w.e. and 0.14\,m\,w.e. for Glaciers 4, 2 and 13, respectively). Our results are consistent with those of \cite{Grunewald2013}, who found that local statistical models cannot be transferred across basins and that regional-scale models are not able to explain the majority of observed variance in winter balance. 

\subsubsection{Simple kriging}

Fitted kriging parameters, including the nugget and spatial correlation length, can provide insight into important scales of winter-balance variability. The model fitted to the gridcell-averaged values of WB for Glacier 4 has a short correlation length (90 m) and large nugget (see Supplementary Material Table S3), suggesting variability in winter balance at smaller scales. Conversely, Glaciers 2 and 13 have longer correlation lengths ($\sim$450\,m) and smaller nuggets, suggesting variability at larger scales. Additionally, \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{simple kriging }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{SK }\DIFaddend is better able to estimate values of WB for Glaciers 2 and 13 than for Glacier 4 (Fig. \ref{fig:observedVSestimated_S2}). Due to a paucity of data, \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{simple kriging }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{SK }\DIFaddend produces almost uniform gridcell-estimated values of winter balance in the accumulation area of each glacier,  inconsistent with observations described in the literature \citep[e.g.][]{Machguth2006, Grabiec2011}. \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Extrapolation using simple kriging }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{As expected, extrapolation using SK }\DIFaddend leads to large uncertainty (Fig. \ref{fig:WSMBspatialvar}), further emphasizing the need for spatially distributed point-scale measurements. 

\subsubsection{LR and SK comparison}

Glacier-wide WB estimates found using both LR and SK are $\sim$0.58\,m\,w.e. for Glacier 4 but both are poor predictors of  WB in measured gridcells (Table \ref{tab:WSMB&RMSE}). For Glaciers 2 and 13, SK estimates are more than 0.1\,m\,w.e. (up to 40\%) lower than LR estimates (Table \ref{tab:WSMB&RMSE}). RMSE as a percentage of the glacier-wide WB are comparable between LR and SK (Table \ref{tab:WSMB&RMSE}) with an average RMSE of 22\%. This comparability is interesting, given that all of the data were used to generate the SK model, while only 2/3 were used in the LR \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{(consistent with the best SK model estimated with 2/3 of the data)}\DIFaddend . Gridcell-estimated values of WB found using LR and SK differ markedly in the upper accumulation areas of Glaciers 2 and 13 (Fig. \ref{fig:LR_SK_map}), where observations are sparse and topographic parameters, such as elevation, vary considerably. The influence of elevation results in substantially higher LR-estimated values of WB at high elevation, whereas SK-estimated values approximate the nearest data. Estimates of ablation-area-wide WB differ by $<$7\% between LR and SK on each glacier, further emphasizing the combined role of interpolation method and measurement scarcity in the accumulation area on glacier-wide WB estimates.

\DIFdelend Grid-scale uncertainty ($\sigma_{\mathrm{GS}}$) is the smallest assessed contributor to overall WB uncertainty. This result is consistent with the generally smoothly-varying snow depths encountered in zigzag surveys, and previously reported ice-roughness lengths on the order of centimetres \citep[e.g.][]{Hock2005} compared to snow depths on the order of decimetres to metres. Given our assumption that zigzags are an adequate representation of grid-scale variability, the low WB uncertainty arising from $\sigma_{\mathrm{GS}}$ implies that subgrid-scale sampling need not be a high priority for reducing overall uncertainty.

\subsection{Context and caveats}
\subsubsection{Regional winter-balance gradient}

Although we find considerable inter- and intra-basin variability in winter balance, our results are consistent with a regional-scale winter-balance gradient for the continental side of the St. Elias Mountains (Fig. \ref{fig:AccumGrad}). Winter-balance data are compiled from \cite{Taylor1969}, the three glaciers presented in this paper and two snow pits we analyzed near the head of the Kaskawulsh Glacier between 20--21 May 2016. The data show a linear decrease of $0.024$\,m\,w.e. km$^{-1}$ (R$^2=0.85$) in winter balance with distance from the regional topographic divide between the Kaskawulsh and Hubbard Glaciers, as identified by \cite{Taylor1969}. While the three study glaciers fit the regional trend, the same relationship would not apply if just the Donjek Range were considered. We hypothesize that interaction between meso-scale weather patterns and large-scale mountain topography is a major driver of regional-scale winter balance. Further insight into regional-scale patterns of winter balance in the St. Elias Mountains could be gained by investigating moisture source trajectories and the contribution of orographic precipitation.

\subsubsection{Limitations and future work}

The potential limitations of our work include the restriction of our data to a single year, minimal sampling in the accumulation area, the problem of uncorrelated SP- and FS-derived densities, a sampling design that could not be optimized a priori, the assumption of spatially uniform subgrid variability and lack of more finely resolved DEMs.

Inter-annual variability in winter balance is not considered in our study. A number of studies have found temporal stability in spatial patterns of snow distribution and that statistical models based on topographic parameters could be applied reliably between years \citep[e.g.][]{Grunewald2013}. For example, \cite{Walmsley2015} analyzed more than 40 years of winter balance recorded on two Norwegian glaciers and found that snow distribution is spatially heterogeneous yet exhibits robust temporal stability. Contrary to this, \cite{Crochet2007} found that snow distribution in Iceland differed considerably between years and depended primarily on the dominant wind direction over the course of a winter. Therefore, multiple years of snow depth and density measurements, that are not necessarily consecutive, are needed to better understand inter-annual variability in winter-balance distribution within the Donjek Range.

There is a conspicuous lack of data in the accumulation areas of our study glaciers. With increased sampling in the accumulation area, interpolation uncertainties would be reduced where they are currently greatest and the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{linear regression }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{LR }\DIFaddend would be better constrained. Although certain regions of the glaciers remain inaccessible for direct measurements, other methods of obtaining winter-balance, including ground-penetrating radar and DEM differencing with photogrammetry or lidar, could be used in conjunction with manual probing to increase the spatial coverage of measurements.

The lack of correlation between SP- and FS-derived densities needs to be reconciled. Contrary to our results, most studies that compare SP- and FS-derived densities report minimal discrepancy \citep[e.g.][and sources within]{Dixon2012}. Additional co-located density measurements are needed to better compare the two methods of obtaining density values. Comparison with other \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Federal Samplers }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{FS }\DIFaddend would also be informative. Even with this limitation, density assignment was, fortunately, not the largest source of uncertainty in estimating glacier-wide winter balance. 

Our sampling design was chosen to achieve broad spatial coverage of the ablation area, but is likely too finely resolved along transects for many mass-balance surveys to replicate. An optimal sampling design would minimize uncertainty in winter balance while reducing the number of required measurements. Analysis of the estimated winter balance obtained using subsets of the data is underway to make recommendations on optimal transect configuration and along-track spacing of measurements. \cite{Lopez2010} found that 200--400 observations are needed within a non-glacierized alpine basin (6\,km$^2$) to obtain accurate and robust snow distribution models. Similar guidelines would be useful for glacierized environments.

In this study, we assume that the subgrid variability of winter balance is uniform across a given glacier. Contrary to this assumption, \cite{McGrath2015} found greater variability of winter-balance values close to the terminus. Testing our assumption could be a simple matter of prioritizing the labour-intensive zigzags surveys. To ensure consistent quantification of subgrid variability, zigzag survey measurements could also be tested against other measurements methods, such as lidar. 

DEM gridcell size is known to influence values of computed topographic parameters \citep{Zhang1994, Garbrecht1994, Guo-an2001, Lopez2010}. The relationship between topographic parameters and winter balance is, therefore, not independent of DEM gridcell size. For example, \cite{Kienzle2004} and \cite{Lopez2010} found that a decrease in spatial resolution of the DEM results in a decrease in the importance of curvature and an increase in the importance of elevation in \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{regressions }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{LR }\DIFaddend of snow distribution on topographic parameters in non-glacierized basins. The importance of curvature in our study is affected by the DEM smoothing that we applied to obtain a spatially continuous curvature field (see Supplementary Material). A comparison of regression coefficients from high-resolution DEMs obtained from various sources and sampled with various gridcell sizes could be used to characterize the dependence of topographic parameters on DEMs, and therefore assess the robustness of inferred relationships between winter balance and topographic parameters.

\section{Conclusion}

We estimate winter balance for three glaciers (termed Glacier 2, Glacier 4 and Glacier 13) in the St. Elias Mountains, Yukon, Canada from multiscale snow depth and density measurements. Linear regression and simple kriging are used to obtain estimates of distributed winter balance. We use Monte Carlo analysis to evaluate the contributions of interpolation, the assignment of snow density and grid-scale variability of winter balance to  uncertainty in glacier-wide winter balance. 

Values of glacier-wide winter balance estimated using linear regression and simple kriging differ by up to 0.24\,m\,w.e. ($\sim$50\%). We find that interpolation uncertainty is the largest assessed source of uncertainty in glacier-wide winter balance (5\% for linear-regression estimates and 32\% for simple-kriging estimates). Uncertainty resulting from the method of density assignment is comparatively low, despite the wide range of methods explored. Given our representation of grid-scale variability, the resulting winter balance uncertainty is small indicating that extensive subgrid-scale sampling is not required to reduce overall uncertainty. 

Our results suggest that processes governing distributed winter balance differ between glaciers, highlighting the importance of regional-scale winter-balance studies. The estimated distribution of winter balance on Glacier 4 is characterized by high variability, as indicated by the poor correlation between estimated and observed values and large number of data outliers. Glaciers 2 and 13 appear to have lower spatial variability, with elevation being the dominant predictor of gridcell-averaged winter balance. A wind-redistribution parameter is found to be a weak but significant predictor of winter balance, though conflicting relationships between glaciers make it difficult to interpret\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{. The major limitations of our work include the restriction of our data to a single year and minimal sampling in the accumulation area}\DIFaddend . Although challenges persist when estimating winter balance, our data are consistent with a regional-scale winter-balance gradient for the continental side of the St. Elias Mountains.
