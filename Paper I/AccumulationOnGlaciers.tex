\abstract{Accurately estimating winter surface mass balance (WB) on glaciers is central to assessing glacier health and predicting glacier runoff. However, measuring and modelling snow distribution is inherently difficult in mountainous terrain, resulting in high uncertainties in estimates of WB. Our work focuses on uncertainty attribution within the process of converting direct measurements of snow depth and density to estimates of WB. We collected more than 9000 direct measurements of snow depth across three glaciers in the St. Elias Mountains, Yukon, Canada in May 2016. Linear regression (LR) and simple kriging (SK), combined with cross correlation and Bayesian model averaging, are used to interpolate point-scale WB estimates. Snow distribution patterns differ considerably between glaciers, highlighting strong inter- and intra-basin variability. Elevation is found to be the dominant control of the spatial distribution of WB, but the relationship varies considerably between glaciers. A simple parameterization of wind redistribution is also a small but statistically significant predictor of point-scale WB. Through a Monte Carlo analysis, we find that the interpolation of estimated values of WB is a larger source of uncertainty than the assignment of snow density or than the representation of WB value within a terrain model grid cell. For our study glaciers, the total WB uncertainty ranges from 0.03 (8\%) to 0.15 (54\%) m w.e. depending primarily on the interpolation method. Despite the challenges associated with accurately and precisely estimating WB, our results are consistent with the previously reported regional WB gradient. (244 words) }

\section{Introduction}

Winter surface mass balance, or ``winter balance'', is the net accumulation and ablation of snow over the winter season \citep{Cogley2011}, which constitutes glacier mass input. Accurate estimation of winter surface mass balance is critical for correctly simulating the summer and overall mass balance of a glacier \citep[e.g.][]{Hock2005}. Effectively representing the spatial distribution of snow is also important for simulating snow and ice melt as well as energy and mass exchange between the land and atmosphere, which allows for better monitoring of surface runoff and its downstream effects \citep[e.g.][]{Clark2011}. Snow distribution is sensitive to a number of complex process that partially depend on glacier location, topography, and orientation \citep[e.g.][]{Bloschl1991, Mott2008, Clark2011, Sold2013}. Current models are not able to fully represent these processes so there is a significant source of uncertainty that undermines the ability of models to represent current and projected glacier conditions \citep{Reveillet2016}. 

Winter balance is notoriously difficult to estimate. Snow distribution in alpine regions is highly variable and influenced by dynamic interactions between the atmosphere and complex topography, operating on multiple spatial and temporal scales \citep[e.g.][]{Barry1992, Liston2006, Clark2011}. As a result, snow distribution is highly variable with short correlation length scales \citep[e.g.][]{Anderton2004, Egli2011, Grunewald2010, Helbig2017, Lopez2011, Lopez2013, Machguth2006, Marshall2006}. As a result, extensive, high resolution and accurate snow distribution measurements on glaciers are almost impossible to achieve \citep[e.g.][]{Cogley2011, McGrath2015}.

Those studies that have focused on obtaining detailed estimates of winter balance have used a wide range of techniques to measure snow water equivalent, including direct measurement of snow depth and density \citep[e.g.][]{Cullen2017}, lidar/photogrammerty \citep[e.g.][]{Sold2013} and ground penetrating radar \citep[e.g.][]{Machguth2006, Gusmeroli2014, McGrath2015}. Spatial coverage of measurements is often limited and often consists of an elevation transect along the glacier centreline \citep[e.g.][]{Kaser2003, Machguth2006}. Interpolation of these measurements is primarily done with a linear regression that includes only a few topographic parameters \citep[e.g.][]{MacDougall2011}, with elevation being the most common. Other established techniques include hand contouring \citep[e.g.][]{Tangborn1975}, kriging \citep[e.g.][]{Hock1999} and attributing measured accumulation values to elevation bands \citep[e.g.][]{Thibert2008}. Physical snow models have been applied on only a few glaciers \citep[e.g.][]{Mott2008, Dadic2010} but a lack of detailed meteorological data generally prohibits their wide spread application. Error analysis is rarely undertaken and to our knowledge, no studies have thoroughly investigated uncertainty in spatially distributed estimates of winter balance estimates. 

More sophisticated models and measurement techniques of snow distribution are available and widely used in the field of snow science. Surveys described in the snow science literature are generally spatially extensive and designed to measure snow depth and density throughout a basin and ensure that all terrain types are sampled. A wide array of measurement interpolation methods are used, including linear \citep[e.g.][]{Lopez2010} and non-linear regressions \citep[e.g.][]{Molotch2005} that include numerous terrain parameters as well as geospatial interpolation \citep[e.g.][]{Erxleben2002} such as kriging, and interpolation methods are often combined (e.g. regression kriging) to yield improved fit \citep[e.g.][]{Balk2000}. Physical snow models such as Alpine3D \citep{Lehning2006} and SnowDrift3D \citep{Schneiderbauer2011} are continuously being improved and tested within the snow science literature. Error analysis has been considered from both a theoretical \citep[e.g.][]{Trujillo2015} and applied perspective \citep[e.g.][]{Turcan1975,Woo1978, Deems2006}. 

The precision and accuracy of winter balance estimates can likely be improved by incorporating more sophisticated tools and interpolation methodologies, and by gaining a more comprehensive understanding of inherent uncertainties. The overall goals of our work are to (1) critically examine methods of moving from direct snow depth and density measurements to estimating winter balance and to (2) identify sources of uncertainty, evaluate their magnitude and assess their combined contribution to uncertainty in winter balance. We focus on commonly applied low-complexity methods of measuring and estimating winter balance with the hope of making our results broadly applicable.

\section{Study site}

Winter balance surveys were conducted on three glaciers in the Donjek Range of the St. Elias Mountains, located in south western Yukon, Canada (Fig. \ref{fig:Sampling}, Table \ref{tab:GlacierDetails}). The Donjek Range is approximately $30\times30$ km and Glacier 4, Glacier 2 and Glacier 13 (labelling adopted from \cite{Crompton2016}) are located along a SW-NE transect through the range. These small, polythermal alpine glaciers are generally oriented SE-NW, with Glacier 4 predominantly southeast facing and Glaciers 2 and 13 generally northwest facing. The glaciers have simple geometries and have steep head and valley walls. The St. Elias Mountains rise sharply from the Pacific Ocean, creating a significant climatic gradient between coastal maritime conditions, generated by Aleutian--Gulf of Alaska low-pressure systems, and interior continental conditions, driven by the Yukon--Mackenzie high-pressure system \citep{Taylor1969}. The boarder between the two climatic zones is generally aliged with the divide between Hubbard and Kaskawulsh Glaciers, approximately 13\,km from the ocean. The Donjek Range is located approximately 40 km to the east of the divide between the Hubbard and Kaskawulsh Glaciers \citep{Taylor1969}. Research on snow distribution and glacier mass balance in this area is limited. A series of research programs were operational in the 1960s \citep{Wood1948, Danby2003} and long-term studies on a few alpine glaciers have arisen in the last 30 years \citep[e.g.][]{Flowers2014}.

\section{Methods}

Estimating glacier midwinter balance involves transforming measurements of snow depth and density into distributed estimates of snow water equivalent (SWE). We do this in four steps: (1) We obtain direct measurements of snow depth and density in the field. (2) We interpolate density measurements to all depth-measurement locations in order to calculate the SWE at each of these locations. This is necessary because we measure density at relatively few locations of depth. (3) We average all SWE values within each gridcell of a digital elevation model (DEM). (4) We interpolate and extrapolate these gridcell averaged SWE values to obtain a spatially distributed winter balance (in m w.e.) across the glacier surface. We choose to use a linear regression between gridcell average SWE and topographic parameters, as well as simple kriging for this process of interpolation and extrapolation. The specific winter balance is then calculated as the areally-averaged SWE. For brevity, we refer to these four steps as (1) field measurements, (2) distributed snow density, (3) gridcell average SWE and (4) distributed SWE. Detailed methodology for each step is outlined below.

\subsection{Field measurements}

\subsubsection{Sampling design}

The snow surveys were designed to capture variability in snow depth at regional, basin, gridcell and point spatial scales \citep{Clark2011}. To capture variability at the regional scale we choose three glaciers along the precipitation gradient in the St. Elias Mountains, Yukon (Fig. \ref{fig:Sampling}b) \citep{Taylor1969}. To account for basin-scale variability, snow depth was measured along linear and curvilinear transects on each glacier (Fig. \ref{fig:Sampling}c) with sample spacing of $10-60$ m (Fig. \ref{fig:Sampling}d). Sample spacing was restricted by glacier travel and the need to complete surveys on all three glaciers within the period of peak accumulation. We selected centreline and transverse transects because they are commonly used for winter balance estimates \citep[e.g.][]{Kaser2003, Machguth2006} as well as an hourglass pattern with an inscribed circle, which allows for sampling in multiple directions and easy travel (Parr, C., 2016 personal communication). To capture point-scale variability, we took 3--4 depth measurements within $\sim$1 m of each other (Fig. \ref{fig:Sampling}e) at each transect measurement location. To capture variability at the gridcell scale, we densely sample up to four gridcells on each glacier using a linear-random sampling design termed `zigzag'. In total, we collected more than 9000 snow depth measurements throughout the study area (Table \ref {tab:GlacierDetails}). 

\subsubsection{Snow depth: transects}

SWE can be estimated as the product of the snow depth and depth-averaged density. Snow depth is generally accepted to be more variable than density \citep{Elder1991, Clark2011, Lopez2013} so we chose a sampling design that resulted in a ratio of approximately 55:1 snow depth to snow density measurements. Our sampling campaign involved four people and occurred between 5--15 May, 2016, which corresponds to the historical peak seasonal snow accumulation in Yukon (Yukon Snow Survey Bulletin and Water Supply Forecast, May 1, 2016). While roped-up for glacier travel at fixed distances between observers, the lead observer used a single-frequency GPS unit (Garmin GPSMAP 64s) to navigate between predefined transect measurement locations (Fig. \ref{fig:Sampling}e). The remaining three observers used 3.2 m graduated aluminium avalanche probes to make snow depth measurements. The location of each set of depth measurements, taken by the second, third and fourth observers, was approximated based on the recorded location of the first observer and the direction of travel. 

Snow depth sampling was concentrated in the ablation area to ensure that only snow from the current accumulation season was measured. The boundary between snow and firn in the accumulation area, especially when using an avalanche probe, can be difficult to detect and often misinterpreted \citep{Grunewald2010,Sold2013}. We intended to use a firn corer to measure SWE in the accumulation area, but cold snow combined with positive air temperatures led to cores being unrecoverable. Successful snow depth and density measurements within the accumulation area were made either in snow pits or using a Federal Sampler to unambiguously identify the snow--firn transition. 

\subsubsection{Snow depth: zigzags}

To capture variability within a single DEM gridcell, we implemented a linear-random sampling design \citep{Shea2010}, termed `zigzag'. We measured depth at random intervals ($0.3 - 3.0$ m) along two `Z'-shaped transects within three to four $40\times40$ m gridcells (Fig. \ref{fig:Sampling}g) resulting in $135-191$ measurements in each zigzag. Zigzag locations were randomly chosen within the upper, middle, and lower portions of the ablation area of each glacier. We were able to measure a fourth zigzag on Glacier 13 that was located in the central ablation area ($\sim$2200 m a.s.l.).

\subsubsection{Snow density}

Snow density was measured using a wedge cutter in three snow pits on each glacier as well as a using a Federal Sampler. Within the snow pit (SP), we measured a vertical density profile by inserting a $5\times10\times 10$ cm wedge-shaped cutter (250 cm$^3$) in 5 cm increments and then weighing the samples with a spring scale \citep[e.g.][]{Gray1981,Fierz2009}. Uncertainty in estimating density from snow pits stems from incorrect assignment of density to layers that could not be sampled (i.e. ice lenses and hard layers). We attempt to quantify this uncertainty by varying three values: ice layer thickness by $\pm$1 cm ($\leq$100\%) of the recorded thickness, ice layer density between 700 and 900\,kg\,m$^{-3}$ and the density of layers identified as being too hard to sample (but not ice) between 600 and 700\,kg\,m$^{-3}$. When considering all three sources of uncertainty, the range of integrated density values is always less than 15\% of the reference density. Density values for shallow pits that contain ice lenses are particularly sensitive to changes in prescribed density and ice lens thickness. 

While snow pits provide the most accurate measure of snow density, digging and sampling a snow pit is time and labour intensive. Therefore, a Federal Snow Sampler (FS) \citep{Clyde1932}, which directly measures depth-integrated SWE, was used to augment the snow pit measurements. A minimum of three FS measurements were taken at each of $7-19$ locations on each glacier and an additional eight FS measurements were co-located with each snow pit profile. Measurements where the snow core length inside the FS was less than 90\% of the snow depth were discarded. Density values at each measurement location were then averaged and error is taken to be the standard deviation of these measurements.

During the field campaign there were two small accumulation events. The first, on 6 May 2016, also involved high winds so accumulation could not be determined. The second, on 10 May 2016, resulted in 0.01 m w.e accumulation measured at one location on Glacier 2. Positive temperatures and clear skies occurred between 11--16 May 2016, which we suspect resulted in melt occurring on Glacier 13. The snow in the lower part of the ablation area of Glacier 13 was isothermal and showed clear signs of melt and metamorphosis. The total amount of accumulation and melt during the study period could not be estimated so no corrections were made. 

\subsection{Distributed snow density}

Measured snow density must be interpolated or extrapolated to estimate SWE at each snow-depth sampling location. We employ four separate methods that are commonly used to interpolate density (Table \ref{tab:densityOptions}): (1) calculating mean density over an entire mountain range \citep[e.g.][]{Cullen2017}, (2) calculating mean density for each glacier \citep[e.g.][]{Elder1991, McGrath2015}, (3) linear regression of density on elevation for each glacier \citep[e.g.][]{Elder1998, Molotch2005} and (4) inverse-distance weighted density \citep[e.g.][]{Molotch2005}.  SP- and FS-derived densities are treated separately, for reasons explained below, resulting in eight possible methods of assigning density.

\subsection{Gridcell average SWE}

We average SWE values within each $40 \times 40$ m DEM gridcell. Each measured gridcell contains one to six measurements (mean of 2.1 measurements) that are averaged to give SWE gridcell values. The locations of measurements have considerable uncertainty both from the error in the horizontal position given by the GPS unit ($2.7 - 4.6$ m) and the estimation of observer location based on the recorded GPS positions of the navigator. These errors could result in the incorrect assignment of a SWE measurement to a particular gridcell. However, this source of error is not further investigated because we assume that SWE uncertainty is captured in the zigzag measurements described below. We are able to combine data from different observers because there are no significant differences between snow depth measurements made by observers along a transect (p$>$0.05), with the exception of the first transect on Glacier 4. No corrections to the data based on observer differences are therefore applied.

\subsection{Distributed SWE}

\subsubsection{Linear regression}

SWE values as determined above are interpolated and extrapolated across each glacier using linear regression (LR) as well as simple kriging (SK). We use LRs to relate observed SWE to gridcell values of DEM-derived topographic parameters, which include elevation, distance from centreline, slope, aspect, curvature, ``northness'' and a wind-redistribution parameter \citep[e.g.][]{McGrath2015}. Our sampling design ensured that the ranges of topographic parameters associated with our measurement locations represent more than 70\% of the total area of each glacier (except for the elevation range on Glacier 2 which is 50\%). Topographic parameters are weighted by a set of fitted regression coefficients ($\beta_i$) calculated by minimizing the sum of squares of the vertical deviations of each data point from the regression line \citep{Davis1986}. For details on data and methods used to estimate the topographic parameters see the Supplementary Material. 

To avoid overfitting the data, cross-validation and model averaging are implemented. First, cross-validation is used to obtain a set of $\beta_i$ values that have greater predictive ability. We select 1000 random subsets (2/3 values) of the data to fit the LR and the remaining data (1/3 values) are used to calculate a root mean squared error (RMSE) \citep{Kohavi1995}. Regression coefficients resulting in the lowest RMSE are selected. Second, we use model averaging to take into account uncertainty when selecting predictors and to also maximize predictive ability \citep{Madigan1994}. Models are generated by calculating a set of $\beta_i$ for all possible combinations of predictors. Following a Bayesian framework, model averaging involves weighting all models by their posterior model probabilities \citep{Raftery1997}. To obtain the final regression coefficients, the $\beta_i$ values from each model are weighted according to the relative predictive success of the model, as assessed by the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) value \citep{Burnham2004}. BIC penalizes more complex models, which further reduces the risk of overfitting. Spatially distributed SWE is then estimated by applying the resulting regression coefficients to the topographic parameters associated with each gridcell. Specific winter balance is calculated as the areally-averaged, integrated SWE for each glacier (m w.e.). 

\subsubsection{Simple kriging}

Simple kriging (SK) is a data-driven method of estimating values at unsampled locations by using the isotropic spatial correlation (covariance) of measured values to find a set of optimal weights \citep{Davis1986, Li2008}. SK assumes spatial correlation between sampling points that are distributed across a surface and then applies the correlation to interpolate between sampling points. We used the \texttt{DiceKriging} R package \citep{Roustant2012} to calculate the maximum likelihood covariance matrix, as well as range distance ($\theta$) and nugget for gridcell-averaged winter balance values. The range distance is a measure of data correlation length and the nugget is the residual that encompasses sampling-error variance as well as the spatial variance at distances less than the minimum sample spacing \citep{Li2008}. SK cannot be used to understand physical processes that may be controlling snow distribution and in the absence of data, cannot be used to estimate winter balance on an unmeasured, neighbouring glacier. 


\subsection{Uncertainty analysis}

To quantify the uncertainty on the estimated glacier-wide winter balance, we conduct a Monte Carlo analysis, which uses repeated random sampling of input variables to calculate a distribution of output variables \citep{Metropolis1949}. This random sampling process is done 1000 times, resulting in a distribution of possible glacier-wide winter balance values based on uncertainties associated with the four steps outlined above. We use the standard deviation of the distribution as a useful metric of uncertainty of the winter balance. Three sources of uncertainty are considered separately: (1) gridcell uncertainty, (2) density uncertainty and (3) interpolation uncertainty. These individual sources of uncertainty are propagated through the conversion of snow depth and density measurements to winter balance. Finally, the cumulative effect of all three sources of uncertainty on the winter balance is quantified.

	\subsubsection{Gridcell uncertainty ($\sigma_{\mathrm{GS}}$)}
To estimate glacier-wide winter balance, we make use of the grid-scale zigzag surveys to represent the uncertainty in estimating the gridcell-average SWE. For simplicity, we assume uniform SWE uncertainty between gridcells for each glacier and represent this uncertainty by a normal distribution. The normal distribution is centred at zero and has a standard deviation equal to the mean standard deviation of all zigzags on each glacier. For each iteration of the Monte Carlo, a set of SWE values is randomly chosen from the distribution and added to the original SWE values. These perturbed SWE values are then used in the interpolation. Uncertainty in the winter balance due to uncertainty in estimating the gridcell SWE ($\sigma_{\mathrm{GS}}$) is represented as the standard deviation of the resulting distribution of winter balance estimates.  

	\subsubsection{Density uncertainty ($\sigma_{\rho}$)}
We incorporate uncertainty in interpolating density measurements by carrying forward all eight density interpolation methods when estimating winter balance. Using multiple density interpolation methods results in a generous estimate of density uncertainty. The density measurement and interpolation methods used in our study encompass a broad spectrum of possible density values. The winter balance uncertainty due to density uncertainty ($\sigma_{\rho}$) is calculated as the standard deviation of glacier-wide winter balance estimates calculated using each density interpolation method.

	\subsubsection{Interpolation uncertainty ($\sigma_{\mathrm{INT}}$)}
We represent the uncertainty due to interpolation of SWE values to observed data in different ways for LR and SK. LR uncertainty is represented by a multivariate normal distribution of possible regression coefficients ($\beta_i$). The standard deviation of each distribution is calculated using the covariance of regression coefficients as outlined in \cite{Bagos2015}. The $\beta_i$ distributions are randomly sampled and used to estimate winter balance.

SK uncertainty is represented by the 95\% confidence interval for SWE in each gridcell generated by the \texttt{DiceKriging} package. The standard deviation of SWE in each gridcell is then calculated and the standard deviation of glacier-wide winter balance is found by taking the square root of the average variance in each gridcell. The final distribution of glacier-wide winter balance values is centred at the SK winter balance estimate and has a standard deviation equal to the glacier-wide standard deviation. For consistency, the standard deviation of winter balance values that result from either LR or SK interpolation uncertainty is referred to as $\sigma_{\mathrm{INT}}$.

\subsubsection{Snow depth}
We observed a wide range of snow depth on all three study glaciers (Fig. \ref{fig:DepthBoxplot_SPvsFS}). Glacier 4 has the highest mean snow depth and a high proportion of outliers, indicating a more variable snow depth overall. At each measurement location, the median range of measured depths ($3-4$ points) as a percent of the mean depth at that location is 2\%, 11\%, and 12\%, for Glaciers 4, 2 and 13, respectively. The average standard deviation of all zigzags on Glacier 4 is $\sigma_{\mathrm{G4ZZ}} =  0.027$ m w.e., on Glacier 2 is $\sigma_{\mathrm{G2ZZ}} =  0.035$ m w.e. and on Glacier 13 is $\sigma_{\mathrm{G13ZZ}} =  0.040$ m w.e. SWE measurements for each zigzag are not normally distributed about the mean SWE (Fig. \ref{fig:ZigzagHistogram}).

%%%%%%%%!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!%%%%%%%%%%%

The standard deviation of glacier-wide mean density is less than 10\% of the mean density. 

The mean SP densities are within one standard deviation between glaciers, whereas mean FS densities are not. 

%%%%%%%%!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!%%%%%%%%%%%

Contrary to expectation, co-located FS and SP measurements are found to be uncorrelated (R$^2=0.25$, Fig. \ref{fig:DepthBoxplot_SPvsFS}b). The FS appears to oversample in deep snow and undersample in shallow snow. Oversampling by small- diameter (3.2--3.8\,cm) sampling tubes has been observed in previous studies, with a percent error between 6.8\% and 11.8\% \citep[e.g.][]{Work1965, Fames1982, Conger2009}. Studies that use Federal Samplers often apply a 10\% correction to all measurements for this reason \citep[e.g.][]{Molotch2005}. Oversampling has been attributed to slots ``shaving'' snow into the tube as it is rotated \citep[e.g.][]{Dixon2012} and to snow falling into the slots, particularly for snow samples with densities $>$400\,kg\,m$^{-3}$ and snow depths $>$1\,m \citep[e.g.][]{Beaumont1963}. Undersampling is likely to occur due to snow falling out of the bottom of the sampler \citep{Turcan1975}, which likely occurred in our study since a large portion of the lower elevation snow on both Glaciers 2 and 13 was melt affected and weak, allowing for easier lateral displacement of the snow as the sampler was extracted. Relatively poor FS spring-scale sensitivity also made it difficult to obtain accurate measurements for snow depth $<$20\,cm.

Additionally, FS density values are positively correlated with snow depth (R$^2= 0.59$, p$<$0.01). This positive relationship could be a result of physical processes, such as compaction, but is more likely a result of measurement artefacts for a number of reasons. First, the range of densities measured by the Federal Sampler is large (227--431\,kg\, m$^{-3}$) and the extreme values seem unlikely given the conditions of our study region at the time of sampling, which experiences a continental snow pack with minimal mid-winter melt events. Second, compaction effects of a magnitude able of explaining density differences between SP and FS would not be expected at the measured depths (up to 340\,cm). Third, no linear relationship exists between depth and SP-derived density (R$^2 = 0.05$). Together, these findings indicate that the FS measurements have a bias which is challenging to correct for.

\subsection{Distributed snow density}

Since we find no correlation between co-located SP and FS densities (Fig. \ref{fig:DepthBoxplot_SPvsFS}), SP- and FS-derived densities are used separately (Table \ref{tab:densityOptions}). SP-derived regional (S1) and glacier mean (S2) densities are within one standard deviation of FS-derived densities (F1 and F2) although SP-derived density values are larger (see Supplementary Material, Table \ref{tab:Density}). Density gradient with elevation differs when using SP (S3) versus FS (F3) densities (see Supplementary Material Table, \ref{tab:Density}) and density-elevation correlations are generally low. 
We adopt glacier-wide mean of SP-derived densities (S2) for our reference case. This is consistent with most winter balance studies, which assume a uniform density for individual glaciers and measure snow density profiles at multiple locations in a study basin \citep[e.g.][]{Elder1991,McGrath2015,Cullen2017}. However, S2 density interpolation method does not account for known basin-scale spatial variability in snow density \citep[e.g.][]{Wetlaufer2016}. 

\subsection{Gridcell-averaged SWE}

The distributions of gridcell SWE values for the individual glaciers are similar to those in Fig. \ref{fig:DepthBoxplot_SPvsFS}a but with fewer outliers. The zigzag standard deviation is almost twice as large as the mean standard deviation within gridcells measured along transects. However, a small number of gridcells sampled in transect surveys have standard deviations in SWE that exceed 0.25 m w.e. We nevertheless assume that the gridcell uncertainty is captured with dense sampling in zigzag gridcells. There is therefore little need to take multiple measurements within a gridcell along a transect. As a result, along-track transect spacing can be decreased to allow for greater spatial coverage of transects to better capture basin-scale variability.

\subsubsection{Linear Regression}

Analysis of topographic parameters reveals that elevation ($z$) is the most significant predictor of SWE for Glaciers 2 and 13, while wind distribution ($Sx$) is the most significant predictor for Glacier 4 (Fig. \ref{fig:BetaCoeffs}). SWE is positively correlated with elevation. It is possible that the elevation correlation was accentuated due to melt onset (1--2 week early), especially on Glacier 13 (Yukon Snow Survey Bulletin and Water Supply Forecast, May 1, 2016). The southwestern Yukon winter snow pack in 2016 was also well below average, possibly emphasizing effects of early melt onset. Many winter balance studies have found elevation to be the most significant predictor of SWE \citep[e.g.][]{Machguth2006, McGrath2015}. However, SWE--elevation gradients vary considerably between glaciers \citep[e.g.][]{Winther1998} and other factors, such as glacier orientation relative to dominant wind direction and glacier shape, have been noted to affect SWE distribution \citep{Machguth2006,Grabiec2011}. There are also a number of studies that find no significant correlation between SWE on glaciers and topographic parameters, with highly variable distribution of snow was attributed to complex interactions between topography and the atmosphere \citep[e.g.][]{Grabiec2011,Lopez2011}. Linearly extrapolating relationships into unmeasured locations, especially the accumulation area, is most susceptible to large errors (Fig. \ref{fig:WSMBspatialvar}). This area typically also has the highest SWE values (Fig. \ref{fig:LR_SK_map}), affecting the specific winter balance estimated for the glacier. In our study, the dependence of SWE on elevation results in $\sim$1\% of the area of Glacier 2 with SWE estimates $>$1.5 m w.e. 

SWE is negatively correlated with $Sx$ on Glacier 4, counter-intuitively indicating less snow in `sheltered' areas, while SWE is positively correlated with $Sx$ on Glaciers 2 and 13. Similarly, SWE is positively correlated with curvature for Glacier 4 and negatively correlated for the other two glaciers. Wind redistribution and preferential deposition of snow is known to have a large influence on accumulation at sub-basin scales \citep[e.g.][]{Dadic2010, Winstral2013,Gerber2017}. Our results indicate that wind likely has an impact on snow distribution but that the wind redistribution parameter may not adequately represent wind effects as applied to our study glaciers. For example, Glacier 4 is located in a curved valley with steep side walls, so specifying a single cardinal direction for wind may not b adequate. Further, the scale of deposition may be smaller than the resolution of the $Sx$ parameter estimated from our DEM. Our results corroborate \cite{McGrath2015}, who undertook a winter-balance study on six glaciers in Alaska (DEM resolutions of 5 m) and found that $Sx$ was the only other significant parameter, besides elevation, for all glaciers. $Sx$ regression coefficients were smaller than elevation regression coefficients and in some cases, negative. Sublimation from blowing snow has also been shown to be an important mechanism mass loss from ridges  \citep[e.g.][]{Musselman2015}. Incorporating snow loss, as well as redistribution and preferential deposition, may be needed for accurate representations of distributed SWE. 

While a LR have been used to predict distributed SWE in other basins, we find that transfer of LR coefficients between glaciers results in large estimation error. The lowest root mean squared error (0.21 m w.e.) results from estimating a LR using all available observations. Our results are consistent with \cite{Grunewald2013}, who found that local statistical models are able to perform relatively well but they cannot be transferred to different regions and that regional-scale models are not able to explain the majority of observed variance. 

\subsubsection{Simple kriging}

Since simple kriging (SK) is a data-driven interpolation method, the RMSE of gridcell-estimated WB values is lower for SK than LR (Fig. \ref{fig:observedVSestimated_S2} and Table \ref{tab:WSMB&RMSE}). However, the uncertainty in winter balance that arises from using SK is large, and unrealistic glacier-wide winter balance values of 0 m w.e. can be estimated. Further, our observations are generally limited to the ablation area, so SK produces SWE estimates in the accumulation area that are almost uniform, which is inconsistent with observations described in the literature \citep[e.g.][]{Machguth2006, Grabiec2011}. Extrapolation using SK leads to large uncertainty (Fig. \ref{fig:WSMBspatialvar}) in estimating winter balance, further emphasing the need for spatially distributed SWE observations in a glacierized basin.

Fitted kriging parameters, including the nugget and spatial correlation length, can provide insight into important scales of variability. Glaciers 2 and 13 have longer correlation lengths ($\sim$450\,m) and smaller nuggets, indicating variability at large scales (see Supplementary Material Table \ref{tab:range&nugget}). Conversely, the model fitted to the SWE data for Glacier 4 has a short correlation length (90 m) and large nugget, indicating that accumulation variability occurs at small scales. 

\subsubsection{LR and SK comparison}
 
LR and SK estimate a winter balance of ~0.6 m w.e. for Glacier 4 but both are poor predictors of SWE at measurement locations (Table \ref{tab:WSMB&RMSE}). For Glaciers 2 and 13, SK estimates are more than 0.1 m w.e. (up to 40\%) lower than LR estimates due to differences in extrapolation (Table \ref{tab:WSMB&RMSE}). SWE estimated with LR and SK differs considerably in the upper accumulation areas of Glaciers 2 and 13 (Fig. \ref{fig:LR_SK_map}), where observations are sparse and topographic parameters like elevation vary dramatically.  The significant influence of elevation in the LR results in substantially higher SWE values at high elevation, whereas the accumulation area of the SK estimates approximate the mean observed SWE. However, when only the ablation area is considered, LR and SK produce winter balance estimates that differ by less than 7\% for all glaciers. Choice of interpolation method therefore affects how SWE data is extrapolated, which has a large effect on winter balance estimates on our study glaciers.

	\label{fig:WSMBDist_LR}
\end{figure*}

\subsection{Uncertainty analysis}

Specific winter balance is affected by uncertainty introduced when interpolating density ($\sigma_{\rho}$), when calculating gridcell SWE values ($\sigma_{\mathrm{GS}}$), and when interpolating WB data ($\sigma_{\mathrm{INT}}$). We find that when using LR and SK, $\sigma_{\mathrm{INT}}$ has a larger effect on winter balance uncertainty than $\sigma_{\mathrm{GS}}$ or $\sigma_{\rho}$. In other words, the distribution of winter balance values that arises from $\sigma_{\mathrm{GS}}$ is much narrower than the distribution that arises from $\sigma_{\mathrm{INT}}$ (Fig. \ref{fig:WSMBDist_LR} and Table \ref{tab:WSMBdistribution_sigma}). The winter balance distributions obtained using LR and SK overlap for each glacier, but the distribution modes differ (Fig. \ref{fig:WSMBDist_LR}). SK generally estimates lower winter balance in the accumulation area, which lowers the overall winter balance estimate. For both LR and SK, the greatest uncertainty in estimated SWE occurs in the accumulation area (Fig. \ref{fig:WSMBspatialvar}). Our results caution against that using extrapolated data to compare with winter balance estimates from remote sensing or modelling studies may produce misleading results. If possible, comparison studies should use observed SWE data rather than interpolated winter balance values.

\end{tabular}
\end{table}

Grid-scale uncertainty is the smallest contributor to winter balance uncertainty. This is likely due to the fact that nany parts of a glacier are characterized by a relatively smooth surface, with roughness lengths on the order of centimetres \citep[e.g.][]{Hock2005}. Low glacier-wide WB uncertainty arising from $\sigma_{\mathrm{GS}}$ implies that obtaining the most accurate value of SWE to represent a gridcell does not need to be a priority when designing a snow survey. However, we assume that the gridcells selected for zigzag surveys are representative of the uncertainty across each glacier, which is likely not true for areas with debris cover, crevasses and steep slopes.

Our Monte Carlo analysis did not include uncertainty arising from a number of data sources, which we assume to contribute negligibly to the uncertainty in winter balance or to be encompassed by investigated sources of uncertainty. These sources of uncertainty include error associated with SP and FS density measurement, DEM vertical and horizontal error and error associated with estimating measurement locations.


\subsection{Context and caveats}
\subsubsection{Regional winter balance gradient}

The glacier-wide WBs of our three study glaciers (S2 density assignment method), with an uncertainty equal to one standard deviation of the distribution found with Monte Carlo analysis, are: 0.593\,$\pm$\,0.029 m w.e. on Glacier 4, 0.608\,$\pm$\,0.049 m w.e. on Glacier 2 and 0.404\,$\pm$\,0.029 m w.e. on Glacier 13. Although we find considerable inter- and intra-basin variability in WB estimates, our data fit are consistent with an accumulation gradient for the continental side of the St. Elias Mountains (Fig. \ref{fig:AccumGrad}). Accumulation data are compiled from \cite{Taylor1969}, the three glaciers presented in this paper, as well as two snow pits we dug near the head of the Kaskawulsh Glacier in May 2016. The data show a linear decrease ($-0.024$ m w.e. km$^{-1}$, R$^2=$0.85) in observed SWE with distance from the regional topographic divide between Kaskawulsh and Hubbard Glaciers in the St. Elias Mountains, as identified by \cite{Taylor1969}. While the three study glaciers fit the regional relationship, the same relationship would not apply when just the Donjek Range is considered. Interaction between meso-scale weather patterns and mountain topography is a major driver of regional winter balance. Further insight into regional-scale winter balance trends can be gained by investigating moisture source trajectories and and the contribution of orographic precipitation to winter balance.

\end{figure}


\subsubsection{Limitations and future work}

Extensions to this work could include investigating experimental design, examining the effects of DEM grid size on winter balance and resolving temporal variability. Our sampling design was chosen to extensively sample the ablation area and is likely too finely resolved for many future mass balance surveys to replicate. Determining a sampling design that minimizes error and reduces the number of measurements, known as data efficiency thresholds, would contribute to optimizing snow surveys in mountainous regions. For example, \cite{Lopez2010} concluded that $200-400$ observations are needed to obtain accurate and robust snow distribution models within an alpine basin. 

DEM gridcell size is known to significantly affect computed topographic parameters and the ability for a DEM to resolve important hydrological features (i.e. drainage pathways) in the landscape \citep{Zhang1994, Garbrecht1994, Guo-an2001, Lopez2010}, which can have implications when using topographic parameters in a LR. \cite{Zhang1994} found that a 10 m gridcell size is an optimal compromise between resolution and data volume. Further, the correlation between topographic parameters and SWE is correlated with DEM gridcell size, whereby a decrease in spatial resolution of the DEM results in a decrease in the importance of curvature and an increase in the importance of elevation \citep[e.g.][]{Kienzle2004, Lopez2010}.  A detailed and ground controlled DEM is therefore needed to identify features that drive winter balance variability. Even with a high resolution DEM, small-scale snow variability created by microtopography cannot be resolved. For example, the lower part of Glacier 2 has an undulating ice surface (5 m horizontal displacement and 0.5 m vertical displacement) that results in large variability in snow depth.

Temporal variability in accumulation is not considered in our study. While this limits our conclusions, a number of studies have found temporal stability in spatial patterns of snow accumulation and that terrain-based model could be applied reliable between years \citep[e.g.][]{Grunewald2013}. For example, \cite{Walmsley2015} analyzed more than 40 years of accumulation recorded on two Norwegian glaciers and found that snow accumulation is spatially heterogeneous yet exhibits robust time stability in its distribution.

% CONCLUSION

\section{Conclusion}

We estimate winter balance (WB) for three glaciers (termed as Glacier 2, Glacier 4 and Glacier 13) in the St. Elias Mountains from direct snow depth and density sampling. Our objectives are to (1) critically examine methods of moving from direct snow depth and density measurements to estimating winter balance and to (2) identify sources of uncertainty, evaluate their magnitude and assess their combined contribution to uncertainty in winter balance.

We find that the method used to interpolate observations has a large effect on WB estimates. On Glacier 4, WB estimates are consistent between linear regression (LR) and simple kriging (SK) but both explain only a small portion of the observed variance. This highlights that although the winter balance estimates are relatively precise they may not necessarily be accurate. On Glaciers 2 and 13, LR and SK are better able to estimate observed SWE values but winter balance estimates differ considerably between the two interpolation methods due to extrapolation into the accumulation area. Snow distribution patterns are found to differ considerably between glaciers, highlighting strong intra- and inter-basin variability and accumulation drivers acting on multiple scales. SWE distribution on Glacier 4 is highly variable, as indicated by shorter range distance, higher nugget value and lower explained variance. Glaciers 2 and 13 have lower SWE variability and elevation is the primary control of observed variation.

For our study glaciers, the glacier-wide WB uncertainty ranges from 0.03\,m w.e (8\%) to 0.15\,m w.e (54\%), depending primarily on the interpolation method. Uncertainty within the interpolation method is the largest source of glacier-wide WB uncertainty when compared to uncertainty in grid-scale WB and density assignment method. Future studies could reduce WB uncertainty by increasing the spatial distribution of snow depth sampling rather than the number of measurements within a single gridcell. In our work, increased sampling within the accumulation area would better constrain SWE extrapolation and decrease uncertainty. Despite challenges in accurately estimating winter balance, our data are consistent with a previously reported linear decrease in SWE with increased distance from the main topographic divide along the continental side of the St. Elias Mountains.

%% TOPOGRAPHIC PARAMETERS EXPLAINED
\subsubsection{Topographic parameters}

First, cross-validation is used to obtain a set of $\beta_i$ values that have greater predictive ability. We select 1000 random subsets (2/3 values) of the data to fit the LR and the remaining data (1/3 values) are used to calculate a root mean squared error (RMSE) \citep{Kohavi1995}. Regression coefficients resulting in the lowest RMSE are selected. Second, we use model averaging to take into account uncertainty when selecting predictors and to also maximize predictive ability \citep{Madigan1994}. Models are generated by calculating a set of $\beta_i$ for all possible combinations of predictors. Following a Bayesian framework, model averaging involves weighting all models by their posterior model probabilities \citep{Raftery1997}. To obtain the final regression coefficients, the $\beta_i$ values from each model are weighted according to the relative predictive success of the model, as assessed by the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) value \citep{Burnham2004}. BIC penalizes more complex models, which further reduces the risk of overfitting.

Topographic parameters are easy to calculate proxies for physical processes, such as orographic precipitation, solar radiation effects, wind redistribution and preferential deposition. We derive all parameters (Table \ref{tab:TopoParams}) for our study from a SPOT-5 DEM ($40\times40$ m) \citep{Korona2009}. Two DEMs are stitched together to encompass the Donjek Range. An iterative 3D-coregistration algorithm \citep{Berthier2007} is used to correct the horizontal ($\sim$2 m E, $\sim$4 m N) and vertical (5.4 m) discrepancy between the two DEMs before stitching. 

Visual inspection of the curvature fields calculated using the full DEM shows a noisy spatial distribution that did not vary smoothly. To smooth the DEM, various smoothing algorithms and window sizes are applied and the combination that produces the highest correlation between topographic parameters and SWE is chosen. Inverse-distance weighted, Gaussian and gridcell averaging smoothing all with window sizes of 3$\times$3, 5$\times$5, 7$\times$7 and 9$\times$9 are used. gridcell average smoothing with a 7$\times$7 window resulted in the highest overall correlation between curvature (second derivative) and SWE as well as slope (first derivative) and SWE. We use the smoothed DEM to calculate curvature, slope, aspect and ``northness''.
