\subsection{Creating DEM}

\subsection{Calculating topographic parameters}
One method of interpolating snow water equivalent (SWE) is to relate the observed SWE with topographic parameters derived from a digital elevation model (DEM) of the study area. The imagery we were using was from the SPOT-5 DEMs and were provided at no cost by the French Space Agency (CNES) through the SPIRIT International Polar Year project \citep{Korona2009}. The DEM has a cell size of 40x40 m. The following topographic parameters were calculated from the DEM in QGIS:

\begin{enumerate}
\item[]\textbf{Elevation} values were taken from the SPOT-5 DEMs directly.

\item[] \textbf{Distance from centreline} was calculated as the minimum distance between the Easting and Northing of the northwest corner of each cell and a centreline that was drawn by hand in QGIS. This was completed in Matlab using the script `CentrelineDistance.m'. 

\item[]  \textbf{Slope} is the second derivative of the elevations. 

\item[] \textbf{Tangential Curvature} represents the curvature in the direction of the contour tangent.

\item[] \textbf{Profile Curvature} represents the curvature in the direction of the the steepest slope.

\item[] \textbf{``Northness''} is defined as the product of the cosine of aspect and sine of slope \citep{Molotch2005}. A value of -1 represents a steep, south facing slope, a value of +1 represents a steep, north facing slope, and a flat surfaces yield 0. 

\item[] \textbf{Aspect} represent what direction a slope is facing with 0${^\circ}$ defined as north. These were calculated using Terrain Analysis in QGIS. 

\item[] \textbf{\textit{Sx}} represents wind exposure/shelter and is based on selecting a cell within a certain angle and distance from the cell of interest that has the greatest upward slope relative to the cell of interest \citep{Winstral2002}. This can be referred to as the maximum upwind slope. Negative $Sx$ values represent exposure relative to the shelter-defining pixel, which means that the cell of interest was higher than the cell with greatest upward slope. Conversely, positive values represent sheltered cells. To determine $Sx$ values, we use the equation
\begin{equation}
Sx_{A, dmax}(x_i, y_i) = \textrm{max} \left[ \textrm{tan}^{-1} \left( \frac{z(x_v,y_v)-z(x_i,y_i)}{[(x_v-x_i)^2+(y_v-y_i)^2]^{1/2}} \right) \right] ,
\end{equation}
where A is the azimuth of the search direction, $(x_i, y_i)$ are the coordinates of the cell of interest, and $(x_v, y_v)$ are the set of all cell coordinates located along the search vector defined by	$(x_i, y_i)$, the azimuth (A), and maximum search distance ($d$max). Code for this calculation was provided by Adam Winstral (2016, personal communication). As done by \cite{McGrath2015}, we computed $Sx$ at 5$^{\circ}$ azimuth increments for $d$max distances of 100, 200, and 300 m. These values were then correlated with observed values of SWE and the A and $d$max values with the highest correlation were used for subsequent analysis (see Table \ref{tab:Sxparams}).
